# Test Contract Matrix

This matrix assigns a primary test boundary to current product behavior. It is
an index for change impact, not a claim that the listed suites are exhaustive.

When a change touches more than one row, add or update a cross-module test only
for the shared fact. Do not duplicate all lower-level cases in Playwright.

## Simulation vocabulary

`Timing Simulation` means the deterministic digital timing engine in
`packages/timing-simulation`. `Analog Simulation` means the structured Canvas
to ngspice or VACASK path owned by `packages/netlist`,
`packages/simulation-service`, and `packages/spice-run`. Tests and documentation
must use those names instead of the unqualified word "simulation" when the
distinction matters.

Recorded ngspice rawfiles are parser and numerical-reference fixtures. Package
builders are unit or module-contract fixtures. A browser Project is a workflow
fixture. Reusing one authoritative, human-importable Project across layers is
allowed, but each layer asserts only the contract it owns. This matrix does not
add or freeze a new full-chain Project; that fixture and its acceptance scope
remain a separate product decision.
