# Architecture Decision Records

ADRs explain architectural choices that remain relevant across modules, file
formats, public APIs, deployment, or long-term maintenance. Normative
specifications describe the complete current contract; ADRs explain why its
major boundaries exist.

## Lifecycle and deletion policy

```text
proposed -> accepted
proposed -> deleted when rejected or abandoned
accepted -> deleted when completely superseded
```

Git is the historical archive. `docs/adr/` contains only proposed decisions
still under review and accepted decisions that retain an active architectural
effect. A superseding change must first move every surviving current invariant
into its successor ADR or normative specification, update incoming links, and
then delete the obsolete ADR in the same target. The repository keeps no
superseded ADR directory and no long-lived `partially superseded` state.

ADRs state current decisions and rationale, not rolling schema references or
implementation progress. Complete current behavior belongs to
[`../specs/`](../specs/README.md); executable contracts provide the evidence.
Replace changed decisions in place or merge and retire them rather than retaining
contradictory bodies with appended amendments.

## Naming and scope

Use the next unique four-digit number and a short decision title:

```text
NNNN-short-decision-title.md
```

Create an ADR only when adding or removing a persistent model layer, changing
compatibility or connectivity semantics, introducing a public automation API,
selecting an external baseline, constraining deployment/licensing, or reversing
another active architectural decision. Routine module implementation belongs
in code, tests, and the commit that carries it.

Use [`adr.template.md`](adr.template.md) for a proposal.
