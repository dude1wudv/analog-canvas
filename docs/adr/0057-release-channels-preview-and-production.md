# ADR 0057: Release channels — Preview and Production

Status: accepted

Date: 2026-09-04

Owners: `worker`, `.github/workflows`, `apps/editor`

## Context

Deploying every merge directly to the public site gives unreleased features no
acceptance surface. A staging environment inheriting Production configuration
also risks taking over its routes or gaining write authority over real data.

## Decision

Use two separately configured Workers with one Preview-accepted deployment
candidate. The configurations are complete files rather than inherited
Wrangler environments; the browser assets and bundled Worker are built once and
promoted unchanged.

- **Preview:** `wrangler.preview.jsonc`, its own hostname and namespaces.
  Every merge to main deploys and verifies this channel. The public shell is
  unindexed and visibly labelled. Public Gallery reads go through Production's
  anonymous HTTP API and Gallery writes are refused. When a Preview-only Google
  OAuth client is configured, human testers sign in and save private Projects
  in Preview's own namespace; CI uses a separate acceptance identity against
  that same Project API. Preview has no binding to Production's Durable Objects.
- **Production:** `wrangler.jsonc`. A release tag or explicit ref dispatch
  selects the candidate. The workflow locates the successful Preview deployment
  of that exact commit, downloads its accepted candidate, applies the Production
  bindings without rebuilding, then verifies and recovers on failure.
- **Candidate:** Preview creates the Worker bundle and browser asset tree before
  deployment, deploys those exact bytes, and preserves them only after all
  hosted acceptance passes. One payload identity binds the artifact to the
  selected commit. Environment routes, bindings, secrets and managed resources
  remain outside the candidate.
- **Runtime state:** `/api/channel` and `ICM_CHANNEL` identify the channel.
  They do not authorize private data or simulator execution. Preview simulation
  has its own owner/admission state and configured executor.
- **Execution:** hosted simulation uses the operator-managed container behind
  the configured gateway/Tunnel. It is not a Worker-native process or a spare
  Cloudflare Container. An unavailable named executor does not silently fall back.
- **Data and identity:** cookies and credentials remain host/session scoped.
  Preview accounts, sessions, and Projects are independent from Production and
  its test data is not promoted or synchronized. Preview's production-Gallery
  view cannot validate private Production storage migrations; those require
  their own tests and release care.

The exact deployment commands, evidence predicate, capabilities, and recovery
limitations are owned by [deployment](../deployment.md). This ADR does not add a
second release gate or promise that Production serves every Preview capability.

## Alternatives and consequences

A Worker version sharing Production bindings cannot provide read-only isolation
by construction. An inherited staging configuration depends on remembering every
override. Both were rejected in favor of a separate public Preview.

The cost is another deployment with its own configuration and runtime resources,
plus temporary artifact storage. Public Preview reveals unreleased work;
`noindex` is not authentication. Production remains deliberate, while a
previously qualified commit can be released independently of later development
on main. Emergencies follow the explicit incident exception in
[working rules](../../AGENTS.md).

## Validation

Channel/configuration tests protect namespace and route separation. Preview
verification must exercise the deployed asset and simulation paths, not just
unit-test configuration objects. Candidate tests protect creation, commit
binding, transfer identity and served-entry equality. Production verification
and rollback each measure the actual serving site. Data migrations are not
undone by reverting a Worker version.
