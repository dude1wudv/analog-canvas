# Electrical Names and Label Display

Status: `accepted`

Primary owner: `packages/model` (label typography), `apps/editor` (text
editing and placement), `packages/edit-engine` (rename transactions)

## Scope

Every canvas label that shows an electrical name: a device Reference
(`instance-reference` binding), a Cell Pin name (`cell-terminal-name`,
including its projection onto a parent block pin), a Net label and a supply
label (VDD Power, drawn rail). Parameter values, drafting text, formulas and
Symbol body text are outside this contract.

## Contract

### Two facts, stored separately

- The **electrical name** is `Instance.reference`, a Cell terminal `name` or a
  Net name claim. It is authored text, stored exactly as typed, connected or
  generated. Netlists, simulation and Agents read only this.
- The **label display** is the label's own `formatOverride` (Project Code
  `format`): RichText saying how the name is drawn. It is presentation only
  and is never read back into a name.

### The one relation between them

A stored display must spell its name: its visible characters equal the name,
or equal it with one `_` omitted at the start of a subscript (the historical
identifier encoding). The schema refuses any other stored display.

### Standard looks

Labels whose look follows from what they label, never from guessing at a
spelling, are created with a stored standard look:

| Role                                             | Names                                                 | Stored look                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Supply (VDD Power, drawn rail)                   | `V` followed by letters/digits                        | Italic `V`, upright subscript rest: V_DD, V_DDH        |
| Device Reference                                 | letters followed by digits                            | Italic letters, upright subscript index: M₁, R₁₂       |
| Voltage node (Cell Pin, Bias Voltage, Net label) | `V` followed by letters/digits                        | Italic `V`, upright subscript rest: V_in, V_BP, V_casP |
| Current (Cell Pin, Net label)                    | `I` followed by letters/digits, except `IN…` and `IO` | Italic `I`, upright subscript rest: I_out, I_REF, I₁   |

The look applies whether the name was typed, connected or generated. Any other
spelling (`AVDD`, `MTAIL`, `RL`, `M_1`, `CLK`, `Vin-`, an input such as `IN`,
`INP` or `INN`, an `IO` pin) gets no standard look and is shown as written. A
stored standard look is recognised by comparing its styled characters with
the standard look of the label's current name; only a
label still carrying it is treated as a default. An author's own format always
wins and is never replaced by a default: removing V_BP's subscript stores
`VBP` drawn flat as the author's look, which later renames keep.

### Labels without a stored display

A bound label with no `formatOverride` is drawn by the historical rule: a bold
italic name in which `_` starts a subscript and a trailing `_bar` draws an
overbar, subject to the drawing's `labels` settings. This rule is kept so
existing drawings keep their look; it is display only and never changes a
name.

### Scripts

Subscripts and superscripts are upright by default: in every standard look,
in the historical rule of any drawing made from now on (`labelSubscriptItalic`
is false), and when the editor applies Subscript or Superscript to italic
text, which never carries the italic into the script. An author may still
slant a script on purpose, by setting Italic inside it or choosing italic
subscripts for the whole drawing, and that choice is kept.

### Existing drawings

Existing Gallery drawings are moved to the standard by an administrator
maintenance pass ([Community Gallery](community-gallery.md#administration)).
It gives drawn supply, device Reference, Cell Pin and Net labels without a
look of their own their standard look, may nudge a restyled label a few grid
units clear of its neighbours or leave one that cannot stay as clear as it
was, sets `labelSubscriptItalic` to false in a drawing that never chose a
subscript slant, and refuses any change to an electrical name or netlist.
For drawings made before these standards, `legacyLooks` also gives a label
whose stored look only copies its historical look its standard look, and
straightens a script that took the surrounding italic along. It is not for
later drawings, where a slanted script is the author's choice.

### Editing

- Changing the visible characters renames the object exactly as typed:
  nothing is inserted, removed or re-cased. Characters the old look hid, such
  as an underscore before a subscript or a trailing `_bar` under an overbar,
  stay where they were around the edit.
- Changing only styling (subscript, superscript, slant, weight, overbar) never
  renames. If a styling change leaves a hidden character with nothing to hide
  it, that character is shown again rather than dropped from the name.
- A label still carrying its standard look is regenerated for its new name
  after a text edit or any rename (Properties, netlist code, Agent, clipboard);
  a new spelling without a standard form returns the label to the historical
  rule. An authored format keeps its styling around the new text.
- Placing a Cell Pin, Net label or supply never alters the name it is given.
- The explicit whole-drawing `labels` action in document Properties is the one
  remaining operation that may change names, and only their subscript case; it
  is undoable. Turning the first-letter convention on or off only changes how
  names are drawn: `Start` is shown as S with subscript tart and stays `Start`
  in the netlist, and a standard look (V_DD, M₁, V_in) is left as it is. New
  drawings start with it off.

### Netlist

Netlists print electrical names verbatim. Obligations of an export format,
such as SPICE instance prefixes, escaping and refusals, are applied only
inside that export and are never written back to a name.

Netlist formats read only ASCII names, so a Greek letter in a Net, Pin, device
or Cell name is written as its standard name in the letter's own case, a
small letter in small letters and a capital in capitals: `φ1` exports as
`phi1`, `Φ1` as `PHI1`, `σ` as `sigma` and `Σ` as `SIGMA`. The capitals that
look like Latin letters (`Α` is `ALPHA`) and omicron are named the same way,
as are the variant forms (`ς`, `ϕ`, `ϑ` …) and the micro and ohm signs
keyboards type for `μ` and `Ω`. The drawing and the stored name keep the letter. Two names that
become the same once written out, such as `φ1` and `phi1`, are refused rather
than merged. Parameter names are not rewritten, because values refer to them.

### Examples

| Name    | Label              | Drawn as                                    | Netlist |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `VDD`   | VDD Power          | V_DD                                        | `VDD`   |
| `VDDH`  | VDD Power          | V_DDH                                       | `VDDH`  |
| `AVDD`  | VDD Power          | AVDD                                        | `AVDD`  |
| `M1`    | device             | M₁                                          | `M1`    |
| `VBP`   | Bias Voltage Pin   | V_BP; turning the subscript off keeps `VBP` | `VBP`   |
| `φ1`    | Net label          | φ1, or φ₁ with the 1 subscripted            | `phi1`  |
| `Vout`  | Net label          | V_out                                       | `Vout`  |
| `MTAIL` | device             | MTAIL                                       | `MTAIL` |
| `CLK1`  | typed Pin          | CLK1; subscripting 1 keeps `CLK1`           | `CLK1`  |
| `V_ref` | Pin without format | V with subscript ref                        | `V_ref` |
| `D_bar` | Pin without format | D with an overbar                           | `D_bar` |

## Design rationale

The same drawing can come from different names (`VIN` and `V_IN` can both be
drawn as V with subscript IN), and one name can be drawn in several ways
(`CLK1` or CLK₁). Inferring either from the other is guessing, so neither is
derived from the other: the name is authored, the display is stored, and the
only link is the spelling check above. Standard looks are stored at creation
rather than computed at render time so that a later rule change never
redraws a drawing its author has already seen.

## Evidence

- `packages/model/src/label-typography.test.ts`: standard looks, role
  recognition, rename following and restored hidden characters.
- `packages/edit-engine/src/standard-label-look.test.ts` and
  `packages/edit-engine/src/net-name-operation-planner.test.ts`: rails, Cell
  Pin, claim, marker and device renames keep stored looks valid.
- `apps/editor/src/features/text-editing/text-editing.test.ts`: verbatim text
  renames, styling that never renames, and hidden-character splicing.
- `apps/editor/src/features/instance-display/default-instance-display.test.ts`
  and `apps/editor/src/features/properties/property-edit-planner.test.ts`: new
  Pin and Net labels take the voltage-node look for V-led names and the
  current look for I-led names only.
- `packages/model/src/label-typography.test.ts` and
  `apps/editor/e2e/manual-editor.spec.ts`: a new subscript is upright, an
  author's slanted subscript is kept, and legacy looks change only on request.
- `worker/gallery.test.ts` (label-look maintenance): a dry run writes
  nothing; an apply needs the checked content, keeps names, netlists and
  history, and leaves nothing for a second pass.
- `apps/editor/e2e/component-insert.spec.ts` and
  `apps/editor/e2e/manual-editor.spec.ts`: placed supplies in their standard
  look, a V-led Net label whose subscript the author turns off without
  renaming the Net, and verbatim canvas renames.

Custom display text that differs from its name (for example Q′ for `Q_prime`),
one-click formatting presets, and a literal default for typed names are not
yet provided.
