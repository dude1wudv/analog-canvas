# Normative Specifications

Specifications define stable contracts that multiple modules implement
against. They describe required behavior and invariants, not task history.

Create a specification when a stable cross-module contract is needed; do not
create empty files only to mirror this table. Start from
[`spec.template.md`](spec.template.md).

## Contract ownership

| Boundary                                               | Sole owner                                  | Other consumers                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Persisted electrical objects and formal declarations   | [Schematic model](schematic-model.md)       | Connectivity, editing and export reference these facts                |
| Logical equivalence, contacts, cut and owner lifecycle | [Connectivity](connectivity-and-routing.md) | Model, transactions and netlist extraction consume the same semantics |
| Atomic mutation, revisions, failure and Undo           | [Edit Engine](edit-engine.md)               | GUI and Agent supply typed intent                                     |
| Extraction, dialect printing and export refusal        | [Netlist export](netlist-export.md)         | Does not redefine saved objects or electrical equivalence             |
| Formal scene, text/formulas and overlays               | [Visual language](visual-language.md)       | Canvas and exporters share composition                                |
| Reviewed artwork, style and fidelity                   | [Razavi](razavi-visual-contract.md)         | Exact values live in linked executable configuration                  |
| Gestures, selection, previews and controls             | [Editor interaction](editor-interaction.md) | References model/engine semantics rather than owning them             |

Project file format and persistence/recovery remain separate protocol and
lifecycle boundaries. Simulation source, execution and numeric results likewise
remain separate contracts, including their currently supported compatibility.

## Specification Rules

Follow the [documentation policy](../README.md). A topic owns its contract once;
other specs, guides and ADRs link to that owner instead of redefining it.

- State status, accountable module and scope. Use a version only when the
  contract has an independent version.
- Describe invariants, ownership, meaningful transitions and failure behavior.
  Distinguish persisted, transient and derived facts where relevant.
- Link canonical schemas and focused tests instead of copying full interfaces
  or validation commands. Add small examples only when they clarify a boundary.
- Include short design reasons beside the rule. A separate ADR is optional
  and must pass its [retention test](../adr/README.md#retention-test).
- Review compatibility when changing an accepted contract; describe the current
  supported boundary, not the history of every migration.
- Omit irrelevant template sections. Keep unresolved product decisions in the
  roadmap rather than calling them accepted behavior.
- Package-internal experiments stay with their local README and tests until
  adopted as product contracts.

When code disagrees, inspect behavior and consequences before choosing which
side to correct. Neither existing code nor an accepted status proves a rule
is reasonable.
