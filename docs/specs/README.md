# Normative Specifications

Specifications define stable contracts that multiple modules implement
against. They describe required behavior and invariants, not task history.

Create a specification when a stable cross-module contract is needed; do not
create empty files only to mirror this table. Start from
[`spec.template.md`](spec.template.md).

## Specification Rules

- State status and ownership. State a version only for an independently
  versioned contract, and link related ADRs when architectural rationale is
  required.
- Define invariants and failure behavior, not only successful examples.
- Include at least one valid example and one rejected example.
- Distinguish persisted data, transient data, and derived data.
- Name deterministic validation that demonstrates the contract.
- Changes after acceptance require compatibility analysis and, when
  architectural, an ADR.
- A package-internal experiment does not become a normative product
  specification merely because code remains in the repository. Its local
  README and tests own that implementation until the product adopts it.
