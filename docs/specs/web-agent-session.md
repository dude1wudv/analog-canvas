# Web Agent Session

Status: `accepted`

Primary owners: `worker/agent-session.ts`, `worker/agent-session-runtime.ts`,
`worker/agent-session-do.ts`, and `apps/editor/src/agent`

The browser Project is authoritative. Clicking **Agent** creates a
session with full circuit editing, file and simulation access for that Project;
there is no permission-tier picker. The relay returns a short-lived pairing
code; claim redemption returns `sessionId`, authorized `documentIds`, a
short-lived bearer, and a
session-bound connector credential. A still-valid claim may be redeemed again
only to rotate both credentials. Bearers are never persisted. The local MCP
Helper may persist the connector in the user's private profile; the relay
stores only its verifier, and session revoke invalidates both credentials.

## Resources

Browser reconnect credentials are scoped to the current tab's sessionStorage,
using the existing durable recovery working-copy ID rather than a mount-local
Project counter. Refresh and Gallery return restore that working copy before
attaching the editor socket. An explicit new/import target does not auto-attach
the old pairing. Gallery displays saved local pairing evidence, never online
status; it does not execute Agent requests. Old localStorage credentials are
not adopted across this identity boundary: existing sessions need one new
pairing after upgrading. No Project content is duplicated in connector storage.

Manual pause remains authoritative across request completion, socket recovery,
and connector bearer renewal. A transport failure does not revoke a pairing.

```

`GET /api/agent/kit` is one small public, static JSON download for the Agent's
private scratch folder. It contains `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, one session
`SKILL.md`, concise authoring rules, and a reviewed built-in Razavi catalog
projection. It contains no Project data, claim code, token, or mutation
operation; it is not part of the Circuit OpenAPI. The catalog supplies only
known built-in authoring facts before first placement; a Snapshot remains the
authority for every object in the live Project. The Agent fetches the Kit only
when a human gives it a connection setup, then writes the listed files locally
before redeeming the claim.

The Circuit resource implements only API 3.0
`capabilities/snapshot/transact/render`. File Resource handles advertised
bounded Project/formal-artifact downloads, approved candidate staging, simulation
raw workspaces, and execution artifacts. The sibling Simulation resource uses
the shared prepare/start/read/cancel/export lifecycle; saved setup edits remain
Project structure edits. See [simulation execution](simulation-execution.md).

There is no arbitrary filesystem or host-code execution resource, retired query
operation, dynamic catalog Snapshot, or unapproved whole-Project replacement.
Running authored SPICE in the configured isolated executor is a scoped simulation
capability, not general shell access.

## Binding and authority

A session binds one browser `projectSessionId`, one Project identity, an exact
Document allowlist, scopes, expiry, and editor secret. The authenticated
browser synchronizes the Cell roster of the same authorized Project in its
existing heartbeat, immediately after structural changes. This allows new
Cells without pairing again and removes deleted Cells. Agent requests cannot
update this roster or switch the session to another Project. The Agent uses only the
`sessionId` and `documentIds` returned by the latest successful claim. Switching
the active browser Document never retargets a request.

Open, Import, Restore, or example replacement revokes the old session. File
Resource staging is isolated and does not replace the Project. A valid staged
candidate can replace it only after explicit human approval in the editor;
replacement then revokes the session and requires a new authorization.

## Credential lifetimes and rotation

The deployed defaults are part of the accepted transport contract:

- a Claim remains redeemable for 30 minutes;
- an Agent bearer remains valid for at most 8 hours and is never persisted;
- the session and its connector expire after 30 minutes of inactivity;
  activity renews the deadline without an absolute lifetime limit;
- a completed request result remains in the idempotency cache for 5 minutes,
  still subject to the configured entry-count and byte ceilings.

Claim redemption, admitted Circuit/File/Simulation/Project operations and their
responses, manual Document edits (including changes to the Cell roster), and
explicit pause/resume reset the idle window. Capabilities probes, connector refresh, heartbeat acknowledgements,
SSE keepalives, and transport reconnects do not. Relay forwards time out after
30 seconds, well within the idle window. The relay persists the renewed
deadline, reschedules expiry, and sends `session.renewed` so browser recovery
and its timer follow the same deadline. `session.expired` ends idle sessions.
The initial connector expiry returned to a client is a deadline snapshot;
resume must ask the server even if that saved timestamp has passed.

Every credential requires a live session, even before its own expiry.
Redeeming a still-valid Claim rotates both the connector and bearer; connector resume rotates the bearer.
Each rotation invalidates the previous credential. Session revoke, expiry, or
Project replacement invalidates the Claim, bearer, and connector together. The
local MCP Helper may persist only the connector in its private user profile;
browser recovery persists neither Agent credential.

## Transport state machine

The Session status resource authenticates the existing bearer (including while
paused) and reads relay observations without forwarding to the browser. Its
canonical schema lives in `packages/agent-adapter/src/envelope.ts`, alongside
the existing Session envelopes. `authorization` is active or paused; revoked
and expired sessions return the existing typed errors. `editor` is attached or
detached, with `observedAt` and the authoritative idle `expiresAt`. Attachment
only means an open socket was observed, not that an operation will succeed.
The read does not resume the session, renew its deadline, or enter the Circuit
request ledger. It is not a fifth Circuit operation.

MCP and direct clients use this same resource for status. The shared client
retains pairing on a failed network probe and reports unknown; its previous
observation remains timestamped evidence, not current confirmation. Only an
actual Circuit response establishes online execution transport. Normal Circuit
operations do not require a status request first.

The official thin browser states are:

```text
idle -> creating -> waiting-for-agent -> connected <-> working
connected -> paused -> reconnecting -> connected
connected|working -> offline -> reconnecting
any live state -> revoked|expired
```

Only declared transitions are applied. Heartbeats detect a stale transport;
bounded exponential reconnect keeps the same Project/session binding. Bearer
tokens remain Agent-side only; browser recovery stores only the editor-side
session record required for same-browser reconnect.

## Idempotency and revisions

Each request ID is bound to the canonical exact payload hash. An exact retry
returns the cached terminal response or resumes the same pending request; a
different payload under the same ID returns `REQUEST_ID_REUSED`. Relay and
browser caches are bounded by entry count, bytes, and session lifetime.

Circuit edits target one exact Document revision. Dry-run and commit share the
same validation path. On `STALE_REVISION`, uncertain write outcome, reconnect,
or human revision event, the Agent refreshes Snapshot state and reconciles
before deciding what to do; it never blindly changes and replays a request.

## Permissions

New browser connections grant the complete supported scope set. Replacing a
connection also grants full access; automatic recovery resumes the original
session with its existing scopes. Pause and Disconnect remain available.

Circuit permissions independently cover Snapshot, render, source spans,
geometry, connectivity, presentation, and temporary semantic editor control.
File permissions independently cover Project download, visual download, and
candidate staging (`project.import`), which also gates the Project resource.
The separate `simulation.run` scope covers Simulation operations and File
Resource simulation workspaces, independent of every edit scope; Simulation
capability and authoring-help requests need no scope. A saved Project-folder
source update needs both `simulation.run` and `project.import`, plus the
connectivity edit scope when it carries circuit edits. The relay checks bearer
token, session/document binding, scope, expiry, body size, and rate limits
before forwarding.

Semantic editor control may select a canonical locator, highlight a Net,
activate/fit an existing Cell, or clear focus. It never advances revision,
enters undo history, or changes Project data.

## Security and failure behavior

- Claims, bearer tokens, and connectors use constant-time comparison and
  redacted telemetry; the relay persists verifiers rather than raw secrets.
- Responses use `Cache-Control: no-store`; payloads and secrets are excluded
  from analytics and recovery.
- Browser offline, revoked, expired, replaced, connector-invalid, permission-denied, stale-
  revision, invalid-request, and request-ID-reuse failures are typed.
- Revoke is locally terminal even when the relay is unreachable.
- CORS/origin, payload, rate, cache, expiry, and reconnect behavior are covered
  by deterministic Worker/browser tests.
