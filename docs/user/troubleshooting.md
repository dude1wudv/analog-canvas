# Troubleshooting

## Import says the entry is ambiguous

Choose exactly one `.cir`, `.sp`, `.spi`, or `.scs` entry. If the selected
files include one `circuit.spi` or `circuit.scs`, it is preferred. Include every
local `.inc` or `.lib` file used by the entry.

## A crossing is not connected

This is intentional. Add a Junction dot at the connection. Never infer an
electrical join from geometry.

## A SPICE statement is reported as opaque

Opaque text is preserved exactly but is not editable circuit semantics yet.
Consult the compatibility matrix and keep the diagnostic when reporting a
missing vendor construct.

## Recovery copies

Safety copies live in this browser's IndexedDB and are never authoritative.
Use **File / Recover Local Work…** to browse them. A damaged latest copy
offers the previous generation; a copy from a newer Project schema cannot be
restored here but can still be downloaded. Deleting one copy never deletes
another Project's copy. If a warning says recovery cannot be saved (storage
full or unavailable), download the Project with the button in the warning. A
reload immediately after an edit may miss that very last edit — the copy
lands within a fraction of a second; reloading after that restores the
latest committed state.

## PNG or PDF export fails

Confirm that Blob downloads are permitted by the browser; PNG also needs Canvas
2D. SVG is the canonical fallback and contains the same formal scene.

## The portable host does not start

Use Node 24 or newer and ensure port 4173 is free. The portable host intentionally
does not accept a LAN address. Use `pnpm dev` for a different development port.

## Agent API requests fail

Use the editor's Agent connection controls and the
[MCP connection guide](../agent/mcp-install.md). Check session expiry, scopes,
the currently authorized Project, and the client credential. Replacing a Project
or revoking a session requires new authorization. A missing simulation environment
is a recoverable configuration error, not proof that the Agent session is invalid.

The portable static host does not automatically start optional services or
discover a simulator. Use only the explicitly configured adapter for that host.

## Accessibility limits

Precise component placement, route-segment and endpoint selection, and Junction
insertion still require pointer input. The schematic does not expose a complete
object-by-object accessibility tree, focus follows DOM order, and shortcuts
cannot be customized. Keyboard-focusable controls and status announcements do
not remove those limitations. Future semantic canvas navigation must use typed
Edit Engine operations rather than simulated pointer events.
