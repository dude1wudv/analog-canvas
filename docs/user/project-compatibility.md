# Project File Compatibility

The current portable Project schema version is `60`. Each instance owns its
parameters, placement, paint and attached labels; the file includes referenced
component definitions. The normalized editor model remains schema 58. It retains schematic-only
hierarchy integrity, a Project structural revision, stable formal Cell ports,
and definition-level Cell symbol presentation. It also has one typed Instance
netlist authority, formal Cell parameters, and Project-local external
subcircuit definitions with stable ordered terminal identities and directions.
Every ordinary Instance has at most one authored `reference`; an emitting
Instance requires it, displays it through a live `instance-reference`
Annotation, and emits the same token. Descriptive attached RichText is an
ordinary literal Annotation with no identity or emission authority. A
Cell Pin is identified by its own stable terminal identity and displays its
Port Name, such as `Vout`; `port` and `port-filled` are only hollow and filled
artwork variants for that independent interface declaration.
Its bound annotation may persist same-text RichText formatting but cannot store
a divergent alias. Equal Port Names remain separate physical Base Nets in the
saved drawing but resolve into the same Logical Net. Drafting
text may also carry one of three polarity-label forms while its editable RichText
content remains independent from the fixed vector marks. Annotations and
drafting objects position at 1-unit integer precision, while Instance
placements, route bends, and Junctions stay aligned to the Document grid. An
Instance may carry an optional `styleOverride.foreground`; when absent,
document style defaults remain authoritative. Historical instance background
overrides remain readable for compatibility but are no longer editable.
Each Annotation may independently carry an optional presentation-only
`textColor`. An Instance Reference or value with Automatic text color inherits
its owning Instance foreground; other annotations inherit the document
foreground. Transformer and T-Coil parameter labels independently bind to
K or a winding value; their visibility and positions survive save/reopen.
Schema 54 adds the optional parameter selector and upgrades schema 53 without
changing the drawing. Drafting text keeps its separate drawing-object color
override.
Rectangles and circles may additionally carry independent border and opaque
fill colors plus a `background` or `foreground` drafting plane. Missing plane
data preserves the historical foreground behavior.
An Instance may also carry optional schematic-only `signalFlowParameters`
(`formula`, `coefficient`, `bodyWidth`, `bodyHeight`) that are independent from
netlist/SPICE parameters. Width and height are optional 10-unit-grid minimums:
the shared Transfer Function renderer expands beyond them when 12-unit formula
text, a fraction, or a coefficient needs more room, and never clips or shrinks
the formula to satisfy an undersized request. A canonical v59 file can be
opened, saved, reopened, and saved again without byte drift.

Schemas v24 through v56 are accepted through the explicit chained upgrades.
Schema v32 adds optional `Annotation.textColor`; schema v33 removes the
ownerless `explicit-equivalence` record. A v32 file without that record changes
only its version stamp. A file containing it is rejected at the exact evidence
path because the editor cannot safely guess whether the intended replacement
was a wire, Label, Alias, or hierarchy terminal. Schema v34 retires the hidden
`explicit-net-property` naming owner. Source-backed local names become
non-electrical round-trip hints, explicit SPICE globals retain declaration
authority, and visible power objects become the owner where one already exists.
Schema v35 unifies Instance References, and schema v36 restores Gallery-copied
reference-shaped RichText labels as mapped Reference presentations while
retaining descriptive attached text. Schema v37 adds the optional Project
`simulation` setup, which records which Cell is the testbench, which analyses
and outputs to run, and which simulator profile to use; simulation results are
never saved, and a v36 file changes only its version stamp. Schema v38 adds
structured TRAN parameters in seconds; a v37 file also changes only its stamp.
Schema v39 adds the mutually exclusive raw simulation setup with bounded
authored files and external dependency identity; a v38 file changes only its
stamp. Schema v40 gives voltage probes concrete object anchors, schema v41 adds
structured DC sweep, and schema v42 replaces the optional singleton setup with
a named setup collection. Schema v43 replaces primitive probes with named,
bounded output expressions while preserving every previous measurement target.
Schema v44 makes terminal-current targets explicit, schema v45 adds saved
scalar measurement rules, schema v46 adds structured Noise analysis intent,
and schema v47 adds selected hierarchy-aware MOS operating-point details.
Schema v48 adds design variables, v49 converts saved simulation intent to
source files, and v50 names those collections simulation folders. Schema v51
adds rectangle/circle fill and front/background drafting planes; a v50 Project
is advanced without changing any authored object. Schema v52 converts the
legacy local-X mirror to independent horizontal or vertical mirroring, and v53
allows 45-degree rotation steps; a v52 file changes only its stamp.
Schema v55 adds independent arrow start/end styles: small, medium, or large
arrowheads, dots, no head, and legacy open arrowheads. Unset ends preserve the
previous head style, placement, and scale; v54 content changes only its stamp.
These additions do not invent intent while upgrading an older Project.
The original file is never overwritten silently. Schemas older than v24 and
versions newer than v59 are rejected by the project-file boundary.

The canonical-current corpus at
[`fixtures/projects/compatibility-corpus.json`](../../fixtures/projects/compatibility-corpus.json)
lists current and explicitly retained historical circuit fixtures. It distinguishes
byte-stable current files, historical inputs tested through migration, and named
rejected inputs. Synthetic regressions cover other previous-version transitions;
the original OTA conversion witness remains unchanged for migration testing.
Retired fields such as first-class
`Document.ports`, `Net.ports`, `spice.*`, and `routeAttachment` are invalid.

An incompatible Project is rejected before it can replace the current browser
Project. Conversion, when needed, is an explicit external operation that must
produce and validate a complete v59 candidate before a human chooses to load it.

Equal visible Label, Port, power-marker, and explicit global-declaration names
resolve to one Logical Net without erasing their separate Base Net identities.
Imported or legacy source-name hints never trigger that union, so composing two
Documents cannot create an invisible connection merely because both sources
used a local spelling such as `OUT`.

Viewport, selection, canvas overlays, import compiler state, Agent session
credentials, and recovery envelopes are not part of the Project file. Browser
recovery is a non-authoritative safety copy kept in this browser's IndexedDB:
at most two recent working copies, each with a current and a previous
generation, each copy at most 4 MB and 12 MB in total. It does not survive
explicitly clearing site data. Use **File / Save** for the formal Cloud Project
and **Export Project File…** for portable bytes. A direct backup download is
shown when recovery storage fails. These operations do not delete browser
recovery copies.

Schema 56 adds optional electrical Wire `styleOverride.lineStyle` (`solid`,
`dashed`, or `dotted`). Styling does not change electrical connectivity or
netlist output. The schema 55 upgrade preserves all existing Route data and
changes only the version stamp. MOS bulk connections retain their dedicated
dash pattern. Select a Wire and set `appearance.lineStyle` in its Properties
code to change it.

Schema 57 makes a locally authored VDD Power Rail an explicit formal Cell Pin.
Opening a schema-56 Project attaches a stable Cell terminal to each local
Rail's existing visible label without changing its physical Net or geometry.
Explicitly Global Rails remain global declarations without Cell Pins.
