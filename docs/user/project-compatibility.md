# Project File Compatibility

The current portable Project schema is `63`; the normalized editor model is
schema `58`. Supported files from schemas 24 through 63 enter through the same
validated reader. Historical input is upgraded or decoded before installation;
all current writers emit schema 63. See the
[file-format contract](../specs/project-file-format.md) for the authoritative
representation and compatibility boundary.

## Opening and saving

New netlist imports retain their original input text and frozen terminal
membership. Earlier projects without this reference still open and export their
current circuit, but cannot reconstruct original routing targets from provenance.
Check and Save reports that reference as unavailable; it does not guess a baseline.
Gallery publication omits archived source text while retaining topology reference.

Use **Import Project File…** to open portable bytes, **File / Save** to save a
private Cloud Project, and **Export Project File…** for a portable backup.
Import/export does not silently overwrite the selected source file or establish
a Cloud Save baseline. An upgraded import needs an explicit save/export.

An unsupported, corrupt or ambiguous file is rejected before it replaces the
live circuit. Versions below the supported floor or above the current version
are not guessed into a usable shape. Some historical records also require a
located refusal: an ownerless electrical equivalence cannot safely be guessed
into a Wire, Label or interface. Keep the original file when reporting or
repairing an import failure.

## What travels with a Project

A Project carries its circuit topology, instances and parameters, referenced
component definitions, Cell interfaces, authored labels/drawing styles and
simulation source folders. Portable connection facts determine physical
membership; equal scoped Net/Port names retain their logical meaning without
physically merging independently drawn conductors. Import provenance alone
does not join Nets.

The authored device Reference is preserved. Netlist export can derive a
dialect-specific name, such as `XM1` for a SPICE subcircuit called `M1` on the
canvas; it does not rename the drawing. Text styling and literal display labels
do not create a second electrical identity.

Simulation source is not an embedded simulator or a guarantee of available
models. Run processes, receipts and numeric results do not travel in the Project
file; use the simulation result export for that evidence.

## Recovery and durability

Browser-local workspace restoration can reopen unsaved tabs and views after
refresh; bounded crash-recovery copies provide a separate safety net. Neither
replaces Cloud Save or a downloaded backup, and clearing site data can remove
both. Undo history, unfinished text-field edits and Agent credentials are not
portable Project content. See
[persistence and recovery](../specs/persistence-and-recovery.md) for storage,
history and failure boundaries.

The [compatibility corpus](../../fixtures/projects/compatibility-corpus.json)
protects current round trips, supported historical inputs and deliberate
rejections. Version-by-version implementation history belongs to the reader,
tests and Git, not a second user-facing schema definition.
