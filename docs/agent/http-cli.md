# Shared-client command line

This path is an explicit user choice, not an automatic recovery from failed
MCP host loading. Report the failed MCP stage before offering HTTP; successful
HTTP execution is not MCP acceptance.

HTTP uses the same server validation and permissions. The version-pinned package
in the MCP bootstrap manifest also runs without an MCP host: execute its binary
with --http followed by a published tool name (connect, connection_status,
get_context, etc.), supplying that tool's JSON arguments on standard input.
Use --http list-tools to read the exact argument schemas, and --http resource
with a resource URI on standard input for quickstart and authoring references.
This is a local entry into the same AgentSessionClient and tool handlers, not
another network protocol. The package must be installed, but no MCP-host
configuration or restart is required. Each invocation is a new process:
persisted connector credentials survive, process-local context does not.
Set ANALOG_CANVAS_API_URL to this exact server. The default connector file is
isolated by origin; ANALOG_CANVAS_MCP_CONNECTOR overrides a file path, never a token.
For caller-managed exact retries, --http circuit accepts the published Circuit
request unchanged, including its requestId and transactionId. Keep that request
before sending; after an uncertain process exit retry it unchanged, never repeat
a higher-level write tool that would allocate a new ID.
The shared client owns bearer refresh, credential storage, bounded HTTP retries
and verified downloads. Do not rebuild lifecycle in a wrapper. An uncertain exit
from a non-Circuit write needs reconciliation with resource state before retry;
`--http circuit` is not a generic simulation retry command.
Read [native authoring](shared/authoring.md) for circuit and result rules.
For raw HTTP rather than this shared client, obtain the independent workflow
from the exact origin's `/api/agent/kit`.
