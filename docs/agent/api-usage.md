# Agent API Usage

## One production lifecycle

1. Call `capabilities` once and obey the returned operations, permissions, edit
   kinds, and byte/transaction limits.
2. Read the returned Project Index and choose one Document. Request exactly one
   complete `snapshot` for that Document; do not construct a query plan first.
   For a blank Document, use only the downloaded Kit's static authoring catalog
   to select reviewed built-in symbols and the VDD primitive; it is not a
   Circuit query or Project state.
3. Reason over the Snapshot's complete instance-pin/Net-terminal mapping,
   explicit Net `powerDomain`, hierarchy references, placements, routes, locks,
   and diagnostics. Never infer supply identity from a label, symbol, or Net
   ID. Load only the circuit-knowledge pages relevant to the observed evidence.
4. After creating new instances, request a fresh Snapshot before wiring so all
   instance IDs, resolved pins, endpoint connections, and MOS bulk facts come from
   the browser. For ordinary wiring, submit one high-level `wireIntent`; for other work,
   prepare generic typed edits. In both cases use the Snapshot revision as
   `expectedRevision` and dry-run any non-trivial transaction.
5. Inspect the dry-run diff and diagnostics, then submit the same edits without
   `dryRun` if the assumptions still hold.
6. Request a `formal` or `diagnostics` render. Repair only evidenced problems.
7. Request a fresh Snapshot before global review and handoff. On
   `STALE_REVISION`, refresh and reconsider; never blindly retry the old edit.

When capabilities reports `semanticControl: true`, an Agent may submit one
`transact.semanticIntent` to make review visible in the browser: select a
canonical locator, highlight a Net, activate or fit an existing Cell, or clear
focus. Use snapshot-returned IDs and hierarchy paths, never canvas coordinates.
Semantic results always have `applied: false` and leave revision, undo, and
Project data unchanged.

When capabilities advertises `resources.file`, use the separate File Resource
instead of inventing a Circuit operation. `download` returns only canonical
Project JSON or formal SVG/PNG/PDF. `stage` accepts a bounded `.icproj.json` or
structural-SPICE virtual source bundle, but does not mutate the live Project;
call `inspect`, then `request-approval`. The human must select **Replace
Project** in the browser. Simulation raw workspaces and execution artifacts use the same advertised
File Resource through its simulation operations. The sibling Simulation
resource provides prepare/start/read/cancel/export; saved folder changes remain
typed Project structure edits. These resources grant neither arbitrary host-file
access nor a general-purpose shell. See the
[execution contract](../specs/simulation-execution.md) and
[MCP simulation workflow](mcp-quickstart.md#simulation).

A successful `transact` returns `resolvedRoutes`: the post-edit resolved
polyline for each Route in `diff.changedObjectIds`. Read it to learn the actual
stored geometry — including any normalization (e.g. `set_route_path`
collapsing collinear bends) — without an immediate `snapshot`. A rejected
`transact` localizes the failure: each diagnostic `path` points at the failing
edit position (`["edits", index]`) or, for a Route geometry failure, at the
Route (`["routes", routeId]`), and `objectIds` names the offending object. Read
`path`/`objectIds` to pinpoint the failing edit rather than parsing the message.

The production operation surface is exactly `capabilities`, `snapshot`,
`transact`, and `render`. Do not invent a validation, planning, compilation, or
fallback mutation endpoint. The deployed OpenAPI examples identify the sole
current request version. No query or compatibility operation exists.

For a hosted session, treat the published OpenAPI as the only request contract.
An HTTP `400` is an `INVALID_REQUEST` Circuit envelope: correct every returned
diagnostic `path`, then retry with a fresh `requestId`. Never retry a changed
payload under an old `requestId`; an invalid request was not forwarded or
committed.

## Local development only: loopback example

The desktop host may start the optional loopback adapter for repository-local
development. It is not published in the browser OpenAPI and is never part of
the hosted Agent authorization workflow. External Agents must use the hosted
session flow below, not this endpoint.

```http
POST /circuit HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:PORT
Authorization: Bearer HOST_GENERATED_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json

{"apiVersion":"3.0","requestId":"cap-1","operation":"capabilities"}
```

Then request the selected Document:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "3.0",
  "requestId": "snapshot-1",
  "operation": "snapshot",
  "documentId": "document-differential-stage",
  "includeSourceSpans": false
}
```

Do not place tokens in Project files, prompts, source netlists, or committed
configuration. Stop the listener when the Agent session ends. `/circuit`
rejects a body `apiVersion` other than `3.0`.

## Web session example (published editor)

The published browser editor exposes the same Circuit API over a browser-
authorized relay (ADR 0016). The human clicks **Agent** to create a
connection with full circuit editing, file and simulation access, then gives
the Agent a short-lived claim code. The Agent never needs
repository source — only this document and the claim code.

The deployed machine-readable contract is available at
`GET /api/agent/openapi.json`. The editor's **Copy message** action includes
the claim code, the MCP bootstrap manifest, and `GET /api/agent/kit` for a
user-chosen HTTP path. The Kit is a small JSON payload whose listed files are
written into an Agent-private scratch folder. It provides operating rules plus a
static, reviewed built-in Razavi authoring catalog; the published OpenAPI
remains the request-contract authority. The catalog is used only before first
placement; the next Snapshot is authoritative for the live Document.

1. **Redeem the claim** (30-minute expiry):

   ```http
   POST /api/agent/claims HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json

   {"claimCode":"<claim-code>"}
   ```

   On success the response carries `sessionId`, `projectId`, authorized
   `documentIds`, a scoped `agentToken` (bearer), a revocable
   `connectorToken`, and their expiries. Select the
   target from those returned IDs; do not guess `document-main` or infer an ID
   from a visible Cell name.
   Repeating a still-valid claim is safe for recovery: it rotates the connector,
   returns a fresh bearer, and immediately invalidates the earlier credentials.
   A non-MCP client may exchange the connector for a fresh bearer through
   `POST /api/agent/connectors/resume`; persist the connector, never the bearer.
   The bearer lasts at most 8 hours and can be refreshed with the connector.
   The session expires after 30 minutes without Agent operations or manual edits;
   activity renews it indefinitely. Heartbeats, automatic capabilities checks,
   and credential refresh alone do not renew it. A saved `connectorExpiresAt`
   is a deadline snapshot: ask the server to resume even if it has passed,
   because activity may have extended the session. Revoke, idle expiry, or
   Project replacement invalidates both credentials immediately.

2. **Call the Circuit API** through the session. The body is the same Circuit
   request schema as the loopback adapter; the relay forwards it to the live
   browser editor after strict schema and scope validation, without applying or
   rewriting edits:

   ```http
   POST /api/agent/sessions/{sessionId}/circuit HTTP/1.1
   Authorization: Bearer AGENT_TOKEN
   Content-Type: application/json

   {"apiVersion":"3.0","requestId":"cap-1","operation":"capabilities"}
   ```

   Then `snapshot`, `transact` (with the Snapshot revision as `expectedRevision`,
   dry-run first when useful), and `render` exactly as in the lifecycle
   above. Every request carries a unique `requestId`; bounded in-memory
   caches in the relay and authoritative browser return the same terminal
   result for a retry without persisting Snapshot/render payloads or reapplying
   the edit.

3. **Use File Resource only when its scope is present**:

   ```http
   POST /api/agent/sessions/{sessionId}/files HTTP/1.1
   Authorization: Bearer AGENT_TOKEN
   Content-Type: application/json

   {"apiVersion":"3.0","requestId":"download-project-1","operation":"download","artifact":"project"}
   ```

   Do not treat staging as an import. It only returns a candidate summary;
   replacement requires the browser-human confirmation and ends this session.

The browser must be online while an operation runs. Refreshing the same tab or
returning from Gallery restores its session record; revoking access ends the
session.
Open/Import/Restore replaces the Project and emits
`document.replaced`; the old token cannot read or edit the new Project — request
a new authorized session.

A transient relay failure is not a revocation. Do not replay an uncertain write
under a new `requestId`; repeat the original request ID to recover its terminal
result, or request a fresh Snapshot after the browser is available again.

The browser detects a silent relay connection after 45 seconds and reconnects
automatically; returning online or foregrounding the page prompts an immediate
check. The event stream also receives idle SSE comments. Agent clients must
ignore comment contents and reconnect SSE after transport failure; neither
heartbeat nor event reconnection replays an operation.

Hiding the Agent details does not pause, revoke, or disconnect the live session.
If the Agent loses its bearer, it exchanges the connector for a fresh one; a
still-valid claim may also rotate the pairing. The user may choose **New connection**
to create a separate session with the same Project, authorized Documents, and
scopes.

## Failure handling

- `INVALID_REQUEST`: repair every reported `SCHEMA_VIOLATION` at its machine-
  readable `path`, then submit a new dry run. The response never echoes the
  rejected value. Malformed JSON uses the same envelope without a fabricated
  field path.
- `PERMISSION_DENIED`: request narrower authority or ask the human/host for a
  new authorized session; do not route around it.
- `LIMIT_EXCEEDED`: split a transaction. Do not drop electrical edits silently.
- `SNAPSHOT_TOO_LARGE`: select a smaller hierarchical Document. The API does
  not fall back to a selector/query DSL.
- `STALE_REVISION`: request a fresh Snapshot and reconsider the edit.
- `EDIT_PRECONDITION`: preserve current state and explain the rejected
  assumption, including lock or pin-map conflicts.
- `RENDER_TOO_LARGE`: request smaller render bounds.

Web-session transport errors (published editor only):

- `CLAIM_INVALID` / `CLAIM_EXPIRED`: ask the human for a fresh claim code.
- `TOKEN_INVALID` / `TOKEN_EXPIRED`: exchange a valid connector once and retry
  the exact request; if connector resume fails, ask for a new connection.
- `CONNECTOR_INVALID` / `CONNECTOR_EXPIRED`: discard it and ask the human for a
  fresh claim code.
- `TOKEN_SCOPE_INSUFFICIENT`: do not retry the same operation; request broader
  scope from the human.
- `SESSION_PAUSED`: wait for `session.ready`; the human paused the session.
- `SESSION_REVOKED` / `SESSION_EXPIRED` / `PROJECT_REPLACED`: terminal; stop and
  request a new authorized session.
- `EDITOR_OFFLINE`: the browser tab is absent; wait for `editor.online` and do
  not blind-retry an unknown write. After reconnect, a repeated `requestId`
  resolves whether a transaction committed.
- `RATE_LIMITED`: back off and retry, respecting `Retry-After` when present.
- `REQUEST_TOO_LARGE`: shrink the payload; the relay enforces a hard ceiling.
- `REQUEST_RESULT_UNAVAILABLE`: that `requestId` already ran but its response
  cache was evicted; do not replay it. Read a fresh Snapshot to resolve state.

No error authorizes filesystem access, raw Project replacement, or a fallback
mutation mechanism.
