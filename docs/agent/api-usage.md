# Raw HTTP session guide

This guide is for a caller implementing HTTP lifecycle, not an MCP tool caller.
Read `GET /api/agent/openapi.json` from the exact editor origin for request
schemas, response envelopes and limits. The Kit does not replace that contract.

## Connect and select a Document

1. Redeem the human's claim with `POST /api/agent/claims` and
   `{"claimCode":"<claim-code>"}`.
2. Retain returned `sessionId`, `projectId` and authorized `documentIds`.
   Keep `agentToken` in memory; store `connectorToken` only in private
   credential storage. Never log credentials or put them in circuit files.
3. Call Circuit `capabilities` for permissions, operations and limits.
   **Capabilities does not contain a Project Index.** Choose a Document from
   claim/resume authorization; read its `snapshot` for Project context,
   resolved pins, Nets, locks and revisions.
4. Follow [task workflow](workflow.md) and [native authoring](shared/authoring.md).
   Use the [catalog](../../packages/agent-adapter/src/agent-authoring-catalog.generated.ts)
   for built-in placement; refresh Snapshot before wiring newly created pins.

Use `Authorization: Bearer <agentToken>` and `Content-Type: application/json`
for session requests. Include `apiVersion` and `requestId` where required;
current examples use API `3.0`.

| Route under `/api/agent/sessions/{sessionId}` | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /circuit` | Four Circuit operations: capabilities, snapshot, transact, render |
| `POST /files` | Project exports/import candidates, simulation source and artifacts |
| `POST /simulation` | Capabilities, authoring help, prepare/start/read/cancel/export and batches |
| `POST /projects` | Reusable Cloud Cells and import into the open Project |
| `GET /status` | Session observations; attached is not execution readiness |

The four-operation restriction applies to **Circuit**, not sibling resources.
These routes do not grant arbitrary host files or shell access.

## Transactions and request identity

Use exactly one schema-defined form: `edits`, `structureEdits`, `wireIntent`,
`semanticIntent` or `command`. Use current `expectedRevision` and, when
required, `expectedStructureRevision`. Semantic focus is non-mutating.

For a risky edit, send a dry run and inspect its diff/diagnostics. Commit the
reviewed payload with `dryRun:false`, **new requestId and transactionId**, and
the same expected revisions while still current. A dry-run receipt is not a
committed edit. See [request examples](examples.md).

After an uncertain response, retry the **identical envelope**, including IDs,
revisions and payload. Never give an uncertain write a new identity.
After a definite schema rejection, fix the payload and assign new IDs.
After a stale revision, read fresh state and replan; changing only the revision
is not recovery. `REQUEST_RESULT_UNAVAILABLE` means a request ran but its
cached response is gone: reconcile current state, do not replay the mutation.

## Simulation through HTTP

1. Discover Simulation `capabilities`; choose an advertised Profile and read
   its engine. Request `authoring-help` for native syntax. Follow the
   [shared simulation rules](shared/simulation.md), not a remembered dialect.
2. Use File `operation:"simulation-input"` with its schema-defined `input`.
   Source read/update uses `owner:{kind:"project-folder",folderId}` or
   `owner:{kind:"session-workspace",workspaceId}`. Saved folders are Project
   structure objects; File `create` creates an expiring workspace, not a folder.
   Project-folder updates use the Project structure revision. Preserve
   generated files; reported editable circuit fields have a separate mapping.
3. Send Simulation `operation:"prepare"` with
   `source:{kind:"project-folder",folderId,expectedStructureRevision}` or
   `source:{kind:"workspace",workspaceId,expectedRevision}`.
   Fields are at the HTTP body's root, not inside MCP's `request` wrapper.
4. On successful preparation, `start` with returned `preparedId` and `digest`.
   Inspect prepared input artifacts only when needed to investigate the input.
   Retain the entire request before sending. Retry an uncertain start unchanged.
   Each new `read` poll uses a new request ID and returned `runId`.
5. Use complete returned data or the run's artifact references directly; `export`
   is an optional inventory lookup. File simulation-input
   `input:{action:"artifact",artifactId,...}` retrieves content using the
   advertised paging fields. Verify byte length and SHA-256 before saving.
   Large receipts may be previews: retrieve complete raw/result/Spec artifacts.
   Follow [result handoff](simulation-result-handoff.md) for browser visibility,
   durable evidence and source export versus results ZIP.

Check both the outer response and resource result for failure. A successful
HTTP request or accepted start is not a successful simulation.

## Resume, failure and authorization

Exchange the saved connector through `POST /api/agent/connectors/resume`
using the published schema. Save returned refreshed credentials; bearers remain
memory-only. Ask the server even if a saved connector deadline has passed:
activity may have extended it. Reusing a valid claim rotates the pairing and
invalidates earlier credentials.

- Invalid/expired bearer: try connector resume once, then retry the exact request.
- Invalid/expired connector, revoked/expired session or replaced Project: stop
  and obtain new authorization. Do not retarget another Project.
- Offline editor: wait for the browser, then reconcile or retry the exact request.
- Rate limit: bounded backoff; honor `Retry-After` when present.
- Missing scope: ask for authority; do not use a second edit path.
- Circuit failures: follow [response semantics](response-semantics.md).

File staging never replaces the live Project. Inspect the candidate and request
approval; only the browser human can confirm replacement, ending the old session.
The browser must be online for operations. Closing connection details does not
revoke it.
