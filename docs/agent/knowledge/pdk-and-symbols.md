# PDK models and symbols

Owner: Symbol registry and Edit Engine for facts; Agent reasoning for proposing
a reviewed mapping. Strength: hard for pin identity, guidance for visual choice.
Trigger: unresolved/generic symbols, model-backed devices, or a requested symbol
change.

## Evidence required

Preserve the exact source model, parameters, terminal count, terminal order, and
existing Net membership. Prefer mappings in this order:

1. explicit session/project import override;
2. exact reviewed model mapping;
3. primitive mapping supported by the parsed model type;
4. unresolved generic symbol.

Nineteen exact SKY130 interfaces are mapped structurally, including the core
and LVT 1.8 V NFET/PFET pairs, `res_high_po`, `cap_mim_m3_1`, and the fixed
`pnp_05v5_W0p68L0p68` and `npn_05v5_W1p00L1p00`. Both exact master name and
ordered public interface must match. No SKY130 family regular expression is an
electrical authority.

The mapped instance keeps its external binding while borrowing native artwork.
Its authored reference remains in the native M/R/C/Q domain; SPICE derives the
X card. MOS exposes D/G/S/B electrically, resistor R0/R1 map to frozen pins
1/2 and B is property-only, and MIM C0/C1 map to frozen pins 1/2. The exact PNP
maps its three public C/B/E terminals directly to the existing symbol; its
model wrapper ties the internal substrate node to C. The exact NPN maps C/B/E
to its visible symbol and exposes its fourth S terminal only as a Substrate Net
property. Their ordinary model-bound Q cards remain three-node. An explicit
external block presentation overrides automatic artwork choice.

The hosted ngspice Profile qualifies only seven of those interfaces: the four
1.8 V MOS, `res_high_po`, `cap_mim_m3_1`, and the PNP. It excludes the exact
NPN. The continuous library does not expose
`sky130_fd_pr__diode_pw2nd_05v5`, while the available four-terminal NPN makes
ngspice 46 discard model parameters. Structural mapping is therefore not a
qualification claim.

## Safe symbol replacement

Use `set_instance_symbol` with an explicit source-pin to target-pin map whenever
connected or routed pins are renamed. Let the Edit Engine update Net terminals,
Route terminal endpoints, and `spice.pin.*` atomically. A rejected duplicate,
missing, or unknown target pin is a mapping error, not permission to detach the
device.

## Counterevidence and failure modes

Text such as `nfet`, a transistor-like Instance Reference, or a four-terminal count
alone does not prove pin order or bulk semantics. Do not discard source model or
parameters after normalization. An explicit mapping to a generic visual block
is still resolved knowledge and should not emit an unresolved-symbol warning.
