# Analog Canvas MCP quickstart

## Connect and inspect

Call `connect` with the browser Claim Code once; omit it to resume the saved
connector. The Helper owns HTTP endpoints, tokens, request IDs and revisions.
Closing the browser details panel does not revoke the connection.
Call `get_context` and read the built-in catalog before placing devices.
Use `inspect` and `search` for IDs and pins, not screenshot coordinates.
Read `analog-canvas://reference/authoring` for the shared native placement,
display, Port, Net Label and simulation-result workflow. It is generated from
the exact `references/authoring-contract.md` served in the HTTP Kit; the tool
examples below are MCP-specific mappings, not a separate operating policy.

Production and Preview both expose the Agent UI. Their accounts, Projects and
connector bindings remain separate.

Before pairing, `connection_status({"refresh":false})` identifies the loaded
MCP version and exact API origin without a network request. Installation and
host loading are separate stages: an installed binary is not proof that this
conversation can call it. Prefer the verified local launch described in
[installation](mcp-install.md). Do not silently replace a failed MCP connection
with HTTP; that path requires the user's explicit choice and is not MCP acceptance.

MCP 0.13.0 adds lightweight Session observations and a direct HTTP executable
entry through the same client. Use `analog-canvas-mcp --http list-tools` to
discover commands; pass JSON tool arguments on stdin, not on a command line.
`--http resource` reads a resource URI from stdin. `--http circuit` accepts the
canonical OpenAPI request with caller-owned IDs for exact retries. Set the same
API origin for MCP and HTTP; their default credential files are isolated by
origin. The connector override is a **file path**, never a credential value.
The new origin-scoped defaults do not adopt the old shared `connector.json`;
use one new claim, or explicitly point at a matching existing credential file.

MCP 0.13.0 supports API 3.0, Project schema 56, setup v4 source/config files
and captured Spec reports. The published 0.11.0 binary supports Spec reports
but predates schema 56 electrical Wire styles. Update that adapter to the
manifest's current version for schema 56 sites; rebuilding an old version
does not replace its immutable release. See
[distribution verification](mcp-install.md). Use it with Analog
Canvas 0.6.0 or newer. It supports independent arrow ends, electrical Wire
line styles, native component displays and attached Net Labels. The public
distribution manifest identifies the pinned release artifact and its SHA-256.
Updating the website does not update an already installed MCP process. Set
`ANALOG_CANVAS_API_URL` only when connecting to Preview or another
non-production endpoint.

Sessions have a renewable 30-minute idle deadline. Agent operations and manual
edits renew it; passive heartbeats do not. A saved connector's deadline may be
stale after activity in the browser: MCP asks the server whether it can resume,
rather than discarding the connector based on its local timestamp. Expired or
revoked server sessions still require a new Claim Code.

Schema 55 arrow objects support independent `styleOverride.arrowStart` and
`arrowEnd`: `small-arrow`, `medium-arrow`, `large-arrow`, `dot`, `none`, or
`open-arrow`. Read the `upsert_drafting_object` contract before editing them.
These fields are arrow-only; legacy `arrowHead`/`arrowHeadAt` remain fallbacks.
Older 0.9.0 adapters may reject Snapshots containing the new fields. Schema 56
adds electrical Wire `styleOverride.lineStyle`: `solid`, `dashed`, or `dotted`.
Route Snapshots expose the complete styleOverride (color, arrow and lineStyle),
so preserve the other settings when editing one. Older 0.11.0 adapters target
schema 55 and may reject a schema 56 Snapshot.

## Create and edit

Use `apply_actions` for one atomic edit batch, wire, planned command or focus
operation per call. Split create and wire phases so new pin geometry comes
from Snapshot. The browser plans commands with the same planners as the GUI;
all resulting edits use the existing controller, revision and permission checks.

| Action                                        | Key arguments                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `set-model`                                   | `instanceId`, `model` (empty clears it)                                       |
| `copy`                                        | `selection`, `offset:{x,y}`; internal wires and references follow GUI copy    |
| `transform`                                   | `selection`, `transform:{kind:"rotate",degrees:90}`, mirror or translate      |
| `align`                                       | `selection`, `mode:left/right/top/bottom/center-x/center-y`                   |
| `detach-move`                                 | `instanceIds`, `delta`; wires stay behind                                     |
| `unplace`                                     | `instanceIds`; retain electrical facts in Placement Tray                      |
| `reset-cell`                                  | `mode:clear-drawing/reset-placement/reset-body`                               |
| `create-cell` / `rename-cell` / `delete-cell` | Cell `id`, plus `name` for create/rename                                      |
| `undo` / `redo`                               | Shared editor history, not a private Agent stack                              |
| `focus`                                       | `intent`: select, highlight-net, activate-document, fit-document, clear-focus |

`selection` accepts `instanceIds`, `routeIds`, `junctionIds`,
`annotationIds` and `draftingIds`; omitted lists are empty.
Drafting rotations in 45-degree steps match the GUI's in-place rotation; other drafting
transforms use canonical `upsert_drafting_object` geometry rather than silently
partially transforming a mixed selection.

`connect` supports `via`, `routingMode:orthogonal/octilinear/free` and
`cornerOrder`. A `route-segment` target uses the Route's stable `legId`
and a `point`; the server owns splitting and Junction creation.
Name Nets through labels/markers, never raw Base-Net fields.

`advanced_transact` accepts exactly one of `edits`, `structureEdits`,
`wireIntent`, `semanticIntent`, or `command`. The Helper supplies IDs and
Document/Project revisions. Read `analog-canvas://contract/edits/{kind}`
for one edit schema (for example `set_instance_style_override`), avoiding the
large `analog-canvas://contract/advanced-edits` resource meant for offline tooling.
Reading is advisory, not a permission gate.
Nested `transact_document` entries use their target Document revisions.

Use `project_cells` to list the signed-in user's Cloud Projects, inspect their
Cell interfaces, and import one Cell into the open Project. Import copies the
complete local dependency closure through the same atomic planner as the GUI;
it does not create a live cross-Project link. The helper refreshes the Project
structure revision when the caller omits it. Sign-in, stale-revision, and
library-compatibility failures are recoverable and do not revoke the session.

Colors use existing `set_instance_style_override`, `set_route_style_override`,
`set_presentation_style` and annotation `textColor` edits. Full inspection
returns these fields, `signalFlowParameters`, Cell interfaces, and external
Model definitions. Netlist parameter values are strings, for example `"1u"`.

`annotate` and `edit-text` accept plain text or canonical RichText:

`connect`/`disconnect` pin targets accept an Instance Reference string or
`instance:{kind:"instance",id:"…"}`; use the latter for imported formal Cell Pins.
`place-component` requires a Reference for devices, but omit it for `ground`
and `vdd-port`. For `port` and `port-filled`, `reference` supplies the new
Cell terminal's name, with passive direction by default. Placement creates its
owned Port, Net and bound terminal-name display atomically; use the returned
Instance ID for subsequent wiring. To place an imported Instance, use `place-existing` with
`instanceId` and `placement` (or `move` from the tray); default labels use the GUI planner.
`place-component` batches use the browser's native display factory: references
and displayable values are object-attached, and power markers own electrical
power claims. Use `set-instance-display` with `instanceIds`, `showReference`
and/or `showValue` to change visibility without creating duplicate annotations.
For transformer (`xfmr`) parameters use `showParameters:{k:true,lp:true,ls:false}`;
for T-Coil use `k`, `l1`, `l2`, `cb`. Keys are lowercase, omitted keys stay
unchanged, and unsupported keys for any selected device reject the whole action.
Set the electrical parameter values before showing them. Hide/show reuses the
same attached labels and preserves their authored placement and style.
`showValue` controls only aggregate Value, never these named parameter labels.
The schema 54 `binding.parameter` field is supported by Snapshot reads and
advanced annotation edits, including hidden labels. Older 0.8.0 adapters can
fail to read a Document containing these bindings and must be updated.
Do not substitute free drafting text for these projections. `add-label` attaches
new labels to their Net's routed geometry when available.
`add-label` and Net Label `edit-text` author the electrical name claim and bound
text together. Deleting the label removes its owned claim, not the physical wires.

`connection_status` probes the current session; closing a panel is not a disconnect.
HTTP 429 retries are bounded and honor `Retry-After` using the identical request
body and IDs. A longer server wait is returned to the caller instead of retried early.

For example, a formula annotation:

```json
{
  "kind": "annotate",
  "position": { "x": 200, "y": 100 },
  "text": {
    "runs": [{ "kind": "math", "latex": "\\frac{g_m}{C}", "display": "inline" }]
  }
}
```

## Verify and recover

Mutation receipts already include authoritative changed objects, edit kinds,
diagnostics and diagnostic deltas. Do not reconstruct the change from a partial
Snapshot or count the same diagnostics twice. Use `verify` for a fresh check
when needed and `render` when visual review matters. On `STATE_CHANGED`,
refresh and re-plan; never blindly replay a changed payload.

`inspect` with `detail:"full"` returns complete Document facts.
`target:{kind:"activity"}` returns recent successful receipts in the current
MCP process, not persistent history or other people's edits.
`search` with `scope:"project"` searches currently authorized Cells.
`inspect` with `target:{kind:"trace",netId:"…"}` returns the GUI's canonical
cross-Cell/global-Net trace. Supply `hierarchyPath` for a particular reused
Cell occurrence; do not infer cross-Cell connectivity from names yourself.

`disconnect` revokes the session. A Project replacement invalidates the old
binding. Newly created/deleted Cells are synchronized by the trusted browser,
without requiring another claim exchange.

## Files and boundaries

`export_file` writes Project/SVG/PNG/PDF to an explicit local path.
`import_file` stages a Project or structural SPICE bundle; inspect it and
request browser approval. Staging is not a completed import.
For Cadence globals, use `action:"stage-spice", namingProfile:"cadence-bang"`.

Exporting a Project file is not Cloud Save or Gallery publication. Account
operations and PVT remain separate work.

## Simulation

Connecting from the editor includes `simulation.run`; there is no per-run
approval or mandatory helper-reading gate. GUI and MCP use the same source,
File and Run resources.

1. `simulation` / `capabilities` discovers the Profile, qualified analyses,
   parser support, declared rawfile collection and resource limits without
   starting ngspice.
2. `simulation_folder` lists, gets, creates, clones, renames and removes saved
   source experiments. Omit the root Cell to create a graphless experiment.
   A saved setup v4 owns authored files, its entry/config paths, generated
   Circuit bindings and declared dependencies. It does not contain another
   structured analyses list. Ordinary Project edits own DUTs, formal ports,
   independent sources and wiring.
3. Use `simulation_files` to read and edit source/config. For code-authoritative
   experiment config version 2, native code owns analyses, `save`, `meas`,
   `write`, `.param`, `.temp` and control. Config owns environment and collection.
   JSON output/measurement/device-OP helpers are for legacy config version 1
   only. Inspect the actual version before choosing a helper. Warnings and
   invalid drafts remain repairable; they are not session revocations.
4. `prepare` with
   `source:{kind:"project-folder",folderId,expectedStructureRevision}` freezes the
   input and returns `prepared.id`, `digest`, vectors and artifacts.
   `prepared.json` contains the exact execution request, `prepared.cir` the
   entry, and individual files/source maps the rest of the bundle.
5. `start` uses `preparedId` and `digest`, returning `run.id` immediately.
   Reuse the same outer request ID and payload for a transport retry.
   `read` / `cancel` use `runId`; each new poll has a new request ID.
   `inputStatus` reports later edits without rewriting that run's evidence.
6. `export` lists artifact references. `simulation_files` with
   `request:{action:"artifact",artifactId}` reads paged content; `outputPath`
   saves complete bytes after length/SHA-256 verification. Deck, rawfile,
   JSON, log and CSV share this File Resource. Large receipts set
   `resultPreview`; full result/output artifacts remain available.
   Read `outputData.specs` or `specs.json` for captured acceptance results, and
   `specs.csv` for portable tabular results. Native `meas` computes metrics;
   source comments such as `* @spec peak <= 1.8 unit=V` declare rules.
   See [Spec annotations](simulation-specs.md). Missing/invalid results are
   `not-evaluated`, not Failed; measurements without a rule are `unconstrained`.
   Use raw/CSV to plot or compare externally. Built-in Plot/Compare/OP views
   and `simulation-plot` image export are retired; native OP still executes.
   Read waveform numbers from `result.data` or `result.json`, not the legacy
   `outputData.analyses` array (empty for new runs). There is one complete CSV
   per analysis record; no automatic measurements or duplicate outputs CSV.
   If `resultPreview` is true, read `result.json` and `specs.json` by artifact ID.
   The full Spec reference is bundled as `analog-canvas://reference/simulation-specs`.

### File ownership and editing

For saved experiments use `owner:{kind:"project-folder",folderId}`. Updates use
the Project structure revision and ordinary undoable transactions. `read`
returns exact text, a SHA-256 `textDigest`, and generated instance/parameter
spans when applicable. `update` accepts writes/removes or UTF-16 range patches
with that digest. `circuitEdits:[{path,textDigest,text}]` maps only reported
editable numeric fields to normal parameter transactions; topology edits go
through Canvas APIs. Project file writes require `project.import`; mapped
circuit changes additionally require connectivity editing authority.

For an expiring graphless session workspace, call File `create`, then
`update` with `owner:{kind:"session-workspace",workspaceId}`,
`expectedRevision`, `entry`, and authored files including a valid config.
Prepare using `source:{kind:"workspace",workspaceId,expectedRevision}`.
Environment belongs to the config, not a second prepare argument. Use
`simulation_folder` instead when this work must survive Project save/reload.

Files and dependencies are virtual-root-relative. Environment owners resolve
declared dependency identities/digests; arbitrary host paths and startup
configuration are not writable. Complete user code owns its analyses and
capture statements; there is no hidden final write. Default snippets select
ASCII/appendwrite and capture after each analysis. Native repeated plots stay
separate records, never an implicit managed Batch.

### Batch and evidence

`prepare-batch` freezes 1–16 saved-setup items at one structure revision.
`prepare-sweep` uses saved Run Plan axes or explicit corner, temperature,
variable or exact-parameter axes. Nominal values come from source; point
projections do not mutate the Project. Both become an ordinary sequential
batch consumed by `start-batch`, `read-batch`, `cancel-batch` and per-run
`read`/`export`. Reuse start request identity after an uncertain response.

Project-folder runs, including batches and sweeps, appear in the GUI's Project
runs list without opening the panel or stealing focus. Open result restores a
completed run without executing it again. Verified artifacts are automatically
archived in this browser; Saved results survives reload, but is not Cloud Save.
Session-workspace runs remain private. Storage failures carry a session-only
warning. Project + results ZIP bundles a captured Project and run evidence;
ordinary Project exports remain source-only.

Run history and rawfiles are not Project objects. Export artifacts and
`evidence-manifest.json` for durable evidence. Browser Archive is a bounded
convenience over those artifacts. No job durability across browser reload is
promised.

Read `error.code`, `stage`, `recovery` and located diagnostics, repair input,
and continue. Missing models, busy executors, timeouts and failed simulations
do not revoke the session. An uncertain accepted execution is `lost`, never
automatically resubmitted.
