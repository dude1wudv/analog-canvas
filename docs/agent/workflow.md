# Circuit changes and human handoff

This is the shared task policy. Use your selected transport's entry guide for
connection and request mechanics; MCP clients need not implement raw HTTP.

## Establish enough evidence for the task

Identify the authorized Document, current revision and affected objects before
editing. Read the complete Snapshot for new construction, unfamiliar topology,
hierarchy changes or broad rerouting. A current targeted inspection can suffice
for a known object's local value/display change; counts alone are not pin or
connectivity evidence. Refresh after placement before using newly resolved pins.

Preserve topology unless the user requests an electrical change. Preserve
human-owned work outside the affected area, including locks and groups. A lock
conflict is not permission to remove the lock. Unresolved pin order, bulk/model
semantics or hierarchy binding requires an authoritative fact or a human answer.

## Make the bounded change

Use [native authoring](shared/authoring.md) for placement, displays and Net names.
Use the shared edit path and current Document/Project revisions. For risky
connectivity, destructive or multi-object edits, validate a dry-run before
commit. MCP `apply_actions` already performs its preview/commit sequence; do not
add another preview ritual unless a separate review is actually needed.

On a stale revision, refresh affected facts and reconsider intent. Do not replay
an outdated edit against a newly substituted revision. An uncertain transport
result is different: recover with the original request identity, following the
selected transport's retry rules. Interpret structured results using
[response semantics](response-semantics.md).

## Review proportional to the requested outcome

| Task | Completion evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Read/explain | Returned facts with remaining uncertainty; no mutation required |
| Local parameter change | Accepted change and current value; simulation only if electrical validation was requested |
| Placement, labels or routing | Changed geometry/connectivity plus a formal render of the affected area |
| Whole schematic or hierarchy | Complete changed-Document review and affected parent contexts |
| Simulation | Completed run, captured input identity and retrieved requested results; see the simulation guide |

For visual changes, use [style guidance](circuit-style-knowledge.md) and
[diagnostic policy](shared/diagnostics.md). Do not mechanically clear observations
or polish unrelated areas. A render does not prove electrical performance.

Report changed Documents, requested results and material unresolved issues with
object IDs when available. Explain intentional findings relevant to the task,
not every unrelated warning. Leave a useful review Document selected without
changing the Project's top Document merely to navigate. Never claim simulation
correctness without naming the actual simulator/model/analysis evidence.
