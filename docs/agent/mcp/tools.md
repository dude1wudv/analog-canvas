# MCP editing tools and local inspection

Use the listed tool schema directly. `describe_tool` offers offline, versioned
discovery from the same canonical definitions: no selectors lists tools and
operations; `tool` + `operations` selects complete call envelopes; adding `field`
returns argument fields and parent context. Array elements use `*`, for example
`{"tool":"circuit_wire","operations":["connect"],"field":"/actions/*/from"}`.
`editKind` selects a low-level edit, not a high-level action. Resource alternatives
remain `analog-canvas://contract/edits/{kind}` and
`analog-canvas://contract/tools/{name}`; the latter also accepts `operations`
(comma-separated) and `field` query parameters. These are optional lookups, not
steps required before calls. Unknown selectors fail explicitly; overly broad
queries return a narrower-selection hint, never a silently truncated schema.

Focused circuit tools retain the `{documentId?, actions:[...]}` call envelope:

| Tool                 | Scope                                                             |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `circuit_place`      | Built-in symbol, Cell and existing-instance placement; power rail |
| `circuit_wire`       | Connect and disconnect                                            |
| `circuit_transform`  | Individual move/rotate/mirror, arrange and detach-move            |
| `circuit_selection`  | Selection transform, copy and align                               |
| `circuit_text`       | Labels, annotations, text changes and annotation movement         |
| `circuit_properties` | References, parameters, model selection and display flags         |

Each is a projection and forwarding entry, not a separate edit engine. Existing
batch compatibility and transaction boundaries still apply; membership in one
tool does not make every combination atomic or supported. `apply_actions`
retains all actions, including mixed families, Cell structure, reset and history.
`advanced_transact` retains full editing authority. Neither is hidden dynamically.
The focused text declaration keeps common fields and plain strings directly
callable; recursive RichText details remain in its exact operation/field contract.
Runtime validation is always complete, including constraints not expressible in
JSON Schema. Native host conversion can still vary; an offline contract response
is data, not another automatically converted tool declaration.

## Create and edit

Use `apply_actions` for one atomic edit batch, wire batch, planned command or focus
operation per call. Split create and wire phases so new pin geometry comes
from Snapshot. The browser plans commands with the same planners as the GUI;
all resulting edits use the existing controller, revision and permission checks.

Several `connect` actions may share one call. They are planned in order on
private state and committed once, with one Undo; a failure leaves no partial
wiring. The existing `wireIntent` transaction field accepts one intent or an
ordered array (up to 64); the combined generated edits still obey the session's
edit limit. Mixed placement/wire/command calls still need separate phases.
Multiple taps on one original Route may use the same pre-batch Route/leg IDs;
the planner follows the split children within that batch.
For a new trunk created earlier in the same batch, use
`{kind:"wire-at",point:{x,y},member:{instanceId,pinName}}` (or optional `net`)
instead of fetching its generated Route IDs. Existing Junctions are reused.
`{kind:"net",net:"name-or-id"}` resolves the nearest conductor on that same
draft. Ordinary `point` remains a free endpoint. A tap at a different-Net
crossing is rejected even with a qualifier: a Junction there would short Nets.

`copy` follows GUI copy for internal wires and references. `detach-move` leaves
wires behind; `unplace` retains electrical facts in the Placement Tray.
`undo`/`redo` share Editor history, not a private Agent stack. Routine layout
work should use move/transform/align rather than reset; choose a `reset-cell`
mode deliberately when discarding drawing state.

For reviewed targets, `set-model` uses the GUI's semantic planner and leaves
binding and invocation generation to the netlist generator; an empty model
target clears the binding. Use raw binding
edits only for custom or unreviewed definitions.

`selection` accepts `instanceIds`, `routeIds`, `junctionIds`,
`annotationIds` and `draftingIds`; omitted lists are empty.
Drafting rotations in 45-degree steps match the GUI's in-place rotation; other drafting
transforms use canonical `upsert_drafting_object` geometry rather than silently
partially transforming a mixed selection.

`connect` supports `via`, `routingMode:orthogonal/octilinear/free` and
`cornerOrder`. A `route-segment` target uses the Route's stable `legId`
and a `point`; the server owns splitting and Junction creation.
Name Nets through labels/markers, never raw Base-Net fields.

`advanced_transact` is the full transaction escape hatch for typed edits not
covered by common actions, not a separate permission tier. It uses the same
validation and revision guards. Its listed schema/help describes the exclusive
payload forms; the Helper supplies IDs and Document/Project revisions.
Nested `transact_document` entries use their target Document revisions.
The complete `analog-canvas://contract/advanced-edits` resource is the HTTP
request envelope for offline tooling, not the MCP tool's argument schema.
Do not load it merely to perform one edit.

Use `project_cells` to list the signed-in user's Cloud Projects, inspect their
Cell interfaces, and import one Cell into the open Project. Import copies the
complete local dependency closure through the same atomic planner as the GUI;
it does not create a live cross-Project link. The helper refreshes the Project
structure revision when the caller omits it. Sign-in, stale-revision, and
library-compatibility failures are recoverable and do not revoke the session.

`project_cells` with `action:"workspace"` exposes `request.action`:
`list` live Project tabs and Cell revisions; `activate` a tab; `open` a saved
Cloud Project (use `background:true` to leave the human's tab selected);
`save` (or `asNew:true`); `copy` a selection or whole Cell into
an explicit live target and offset. Copy follows the same atomic, undoable GUI
planner including dependencies. Live tab contents include unsaved work; the
existing Cloud list/inspect/import actions read saved versions.

To work on another open Project without selecting its tab, call `project_cells`
with `action:"bind-workspace",workspaceId` from `list` or `open`. The binding
belongs to this MCP client and applies to Circuit, Project, File and Simulation
requests. Pass `workspaceId:null` to return to the human's active tab. A closed
target fails with `WORKSPACE_NOT_FOUND`; list and bind another copy rather than
silently redirecting an edit. `workspace.activate` remains an explicit request
to show a Project in the editor.

Use `gallery_circuits` to traverse the complete public Gallery. `list` is
cursor-paged; continue with `nextCursor` until it is `null`. `read` returns one
entry's complete canonical Project Code and, by default, its generated SPICE
netlist. `read-many` accepts up to 12 listed IDs and reads them concurrently;
continue any returned `remainingEntryIds` when the response-size guard stops a
batch early. Select Spectre explicitly or pass `netlistFormat:null` when only
the Project Code is needed. This reads the same public Gallery records as the
UI; it does not copy them into the active Project.

Use `project_code` to read or replace the complete open Project. A replacement
is parsed and committed through the same revision-guarded, undoable Project
Code path as the Editor panel, so adding, updating or removing Cells and
objects has one source of truth. Use `netlist_code` to read generated SPICE or
Spectre and to replace the text-editable device names, model targets and
parameter values. Topology, ports and connectivity remain Project Code or
structured-edit operations; the Netlist tool does not maintain a second
netlist-import interpretation of the circuit.

Colors use existing `set_instance_style_override`, `set_route_style_override`,
`set_presentation_style` and annotation `textColor` edits. Full inspection
returns these fields, `signalFlowParameters`, Cell interfaces, and external
Model definitions. Netlist parameter values are strings, for example `"1u"`.

`annotate` and `edit-text` accept plain text or canonical RichText.
For bound Cell Pin and Value labels, `edit-text` changes the look only and
requires the same displayed characters. A Value look follows later parameter
changes; the electrical parameter remains authoritative.

`connect`/`disconnect` pin targets accept an Instance Reference string or
`instance:{kind:"instance",id:"…"}`; use the latter for imported formal Cell Pins.
`place-component` requires a Reference for devices, but omit it for `ground`
and `vdd-port`. For `port` and `port-filled`, `reference` supplies the new
Cell terminal's name, with passive direction by default. Placement creates its
owned Port, Net and bound terminal-name display atomically; use the returned
Instance ID for subsequent wiring. To place an imported Instance, use `place-existing` with
`instanceId` and `placement` (or `move` from the tray); default labels use the GUI planner.
`place-component` batches use the browser's native display factory: references
and displayable values are object-attached, and power markers own electrical
power claims. Use `set-instance-display` with `instanceIds`, `showReference`
and/or `showValue` to change visibility without creating duplicate annotations.
For transformer (`xfmr`) parameters use `showParameters:{k:true,lp:true,ls:false}`;
for T-Coil use `k`, `l1`, `l2`, `cb`. Keys are lowercase, omitted keys stay
unchanged, and unsupported keys for any selected device reject the whole action.
Set the electrical parameter values before showing them. Hide/show reuses the
same attached labels and preserves their authored placement and style.
`showValue` controls only aggregate Value, never these named parameter labels.
The `binding.parameter` field is supported by Snapshot reads and advanced
annotation edits, including hidden labels.
Do not substitute free drafting text for these projections. `add-label` attaches
new labels to their Net's routed geometry when available.
`add-label` and Net Label `edit-text` author the electrical name claim and bound
text together. Deleting the label removes its owned claim, not the physical wires.

`connection_status` probes the current session; closing a panel is not a disconnect.
HTTP 429 retries are bounded and honor `Retry-After` using the identical request
body and IDs. A longer server wait is returned to the caller instead of retried early.

For example, a formula annotation:

```json
{
  "kind": "annotate",
  "position": { "x": 200, "y": 100 },
  "text": {
    "runs": [{ "kind": "math", "latex": "\\frac{g_m}{C}", "display": "inline" }]
  }
}
```

## Verify and recover

Mutation receipts already include authoritative changed-object IDs, edit kinds,
diagnostics and diagnostic deltas. Do not reconstruct the change from a partial
Snapshot or count the same diagnostics twice. Use `verify` for a fresh check
when needed and `render` when visual review matters. On `STATE_CHANGED`,
refresh and re-plan; never blindly replay a changed payload.

`inspect` with `target:{kind:"document"},detail:"full"` returns complete
Document facts.
`inspect` with `target:{kind:"geometry",objectIds:["…"]}` reads up to 64
specific authored objects (placement, routes, junctions, annotation anchors,
drafting and no-connect objects). It returns current revision and missing IDs
without resolving the full circuit. Use it after local movement; use the full
inspection for pins, Nets and connectivity. `get_context` and
`target:{kind:"diagnostics"}` use lightweight server reads for revision/counts
and diagnostic items. `simulation_folder` list reads folder metadata without
source bodies; get/edit still load the required Project. An older Editor may
fall back to the full read while the deployment rolls out.
`target:{kind:"activity"}` returns recent successful receipts in the current
MCP process, not persistent history or other people's edits.
`search` with `scope:"project"` searches currently authorized Cells.
`inspect` with `target:{kind:"trace",netId:"…"}` returns the GUI's canonical
cross-Cell/global-Net trace. Supply `hierarchyPath` for a particular reused
Cell occurrence; do not infer cross-Cell connectivity from names yourself.

`disconnect` revokes the workspace session. Project/Cell switching and Gallery
navigation do not. `PROJECT_CONTEXT_STALE` requires refreshed context and a new
plan, not another Claim; `NO_ACTIVE_PROJECT` means the browser is in Gallery.
The client carries context stamps automatically and never redirects old writes.

## Files and boundaries

For a read-only milestone, `verify` optionally accepts
`expectedNetlist:{text:"<structural SPICE>",cell:"<reference root>"}` and
`details:true`. Omit it to retain the ordinary Snapshot-only check. Comparison
reads the existing structural netlist, pairs unique device References and pin
positions, and compares formal port order, targets, literal parameters, scope
and endpoint membership; internal auto Net names do not matter. It recursively
checks matched child definitions, without flattening or guessing renamed devices.
Counts are default; details includes at most 200 differences with an explicit
truncation flag. A difference may affect several endpoint memberships.
Parameterized hierarchy, expressions, model bodies, unresolved or preserved
statements yield `inconclusive`, possibly alongside known differences.
SPICE has no Port direction metadata: this comparison does not test directions,
library model internals or simulated performance. Snapshot diagnostics and the
subsequent structural export are separate reads, not an atomic revision snapshot.
No import reference is rewritten and no verification call is required before edits.

`export_file` writes Project/SVG/PNG/PDF to an explicit local path.
`import_file` stages a Project or structural SPICE bundle. Inspect the candidate,
then use `action:"open"` to open it in a new Project tab without replacing the
current work. Staging alone is not a completed import. Use
`action:"inspect",candidateId,documentId` to read one staged Cell as
`documentCode`; stage summaries list Cell IDs. `action:"import-cell"` with
`sourceDocumentId,targetDocumentId,mode:"replace-body"|"append"` commits into
an existing Cell, including its dependency closure, in one undoable Project
edit. The shared client supplies missing `expectedRevision` and
`expectedStructureRevision`; explicit stale values reject. The candidate is
consumed only on success. This operation requires `project.import` and the
existing geometry/connectivity/presentation edit scopes, not a GUI approval.
It preserves the target Cell ID, formal terminal IDs/order, symbol pin layout
and parent callers. An uncalled Cell with no terminals can adopt the imported
interface. Otherwise named terminals must match (append may use a subset), and
parameters must already be compatible. Append retains existing interface
owners, joins only declared matching terminals or compatible global Nets,
and rejects local-name/Reference conflicts rather than guessing a rename.
Resolve missing MOS bulk first; append does not retarget existing bulk.
Append retains the destination's frozen import-reference baseline and source
status becomes modified; it does not silently redefine a verification target.
Geometry is not auto-arranged. Use whole-Project
`action:"request-approval"` only when the human wants to replace the current
Project in the browser. After either Project switch, refresh connection status
and read the new Document context; the existing pairing remains valid.
For Cadence globals, use `action:"stage-spice", namingProfile:"cadence-bang"`.

Exporting a Project file is not Cloud Save or Gallery publication. Account
operations remain separate work. Simulation sweeps use the Simulation resource.
