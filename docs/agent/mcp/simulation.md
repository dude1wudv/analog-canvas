# MCP simulation tools

## Normal task

Use the focused tool's displayed arguments directly. Query `describe_tool` for
an unfamiliar field only; no full-contract or authoring-help prerequisite.

1. Discover `simulation_run` capabilities once; choose an advertised Profile
   and its engine. Read `netlist_code`/the relevant Cell interface for a drawn DUT,
   not the entire drawing. Profile-managed model loads need no duplicate `.lib`.
   Full capabilities (optionally `profileId`) are for detailed model facts.
2. Create a saved `simulation_folder`, or reuse the current folder.
   Creation returns its source owner, revision and paths. Use `simulation_edit`
   for native code; `simulation_source` read `detail:"text"` reads code without
   generated parameter mappings. Use `detail:"mapped"` for mapped Circuit edits.
   Reuse successful update revisions/digests without a confirmation reread.
3. Normally call `simulation_run` with `request:{operation:"run",source:...}`
   and optional outer `waitMs:20000`. Use a project-folder source with `folderId`
   and `expectedStructureRevision` from the latest source update (or a workspace
   source with `workspaceId` and `expectedRevision`). This captures input before
   network waits, prepares and submits once. Keep the same request ID and payload
   on uncertain retries. Explicit `prepare` → `start` remains optional when you
   want to inspect or reuse a frozen input; it is not a normal prerequisite.
   The normal path holds the run submission within one bounded Agent relay
   request; a still-running receipt can be continued with a bounded read.
   This wait never starts another run.
   Continue a running result with `read` and the same run ID, never another start.
   Preserve an uncertain start's request ID. One hosted slot means sequential
   starts or `simulation_batch`.
4. For a graph, call `simulation_plot` `prepare-plot` directly with `runId`,
   a new `name`, and `panels:[{analysisIndex:0,signals:[{signal:"v(out)"}]}]`
   or a DC/AC/TRAN/Noise preset. Choose indices from `run.details.analyses`;
   full signal/file mappings remain in the catalog when needed. Axis labels
   omit units (the template appends them). It fetches selected tables itself:
   **no preceding sync is needed**. Check Python >=3.10 and matplotlib once per
   local environment, execute the returned argument vector, and inspect the image.
   `dataStatus`, `scriptStatus`, `imageStatus` distinguish downloaded data,
   prepared code and actual rendering. Nothing installs or executes automatically.
5. For custom analysis use `simulation_data` `sync`, selecting `analysisIndex`
   and `roles:["table"]` if appropriate. Omit selectors when a complete evidence
   archive is requested; `fileIds:[]` updates only the directory. Local files are reused.
   The default receipt keeps current-task counts and up to 16 file paths/timings;
   larger selections use `filesOmitted` and the local index. Outer `detail:"full"`
   retains every file and history. Explicit `workspace` lists local runs.
   Full identities, units and dataset mapping remain in the returned local index.
   `simulation_results` `catalog` is the explicit full remote directory, not
   a mandatory extra step. Read data locally rather than paging waveform previews.

Iteration: edit → run/wait → plot or selected sync. Do not repeat
connection, discovery, folder creation, environment checks or full archive
downloads when their inputs have not changed. Select the final files needed
for the requested handoff; a complete archive is optional.
For styling-only iterations, edit and execute the existing local plot script;
no connection, sync or new plot preparation is needed.

## Results and freshness

Check execution, collection, per-analysis diagnostics and requested measurements
independently; completion does not prove every analysis produced data.
`run.details` summarizes collection/Specs and separates executor wait, result
materialization and catalog-save time. Managed runs additionally report server
queue/execution, result fetch and client polling. Simulator-only time remains
`result.durationMs`; do not treat it as end-to-end latency. Registered files hold
complete evidence.
Run summaries reference the catalog instead of repeating its file list; outer
`detail:"full"` retains the complete run metadata response.
`export` retries failed evidence saving on the same run without executing again.

History deletion/retention, cache freshness and transfer details are in
[detailed contracts](simulation-reference.md); they are not steps in an ordinary run.

Prepare's default summary points to complete `preparation.json`; outer
`detail:"full"` exposes it inline. OP mappings describe available vectors, not
captured values; explicitly save needed device parameters (`save all` is not
every parameter). Native source remains authoritative.

Read [detailed contracts](simulation-reference.md) only for native Noise capture,
OP mappings, patch semantics, Batch, plot units/cursors or recovery.
`simulation` and `simulation_files` remain compatible broad entries sharing
the same implementation. There is no new protocol or permission gate.
