# Deployment

## Channels and data isolation

| Channel | Trigger and configuration | Data boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Self-hosted | `containers/self-host/deploy.sh <commit>` on the operator host | Persistent local data, secrets, and simulator services remain on the host |
| Production | `v*` tag or explicit commit dispatch; `.github/workflows/cloudflare.yml`; `wrangler.jsonc` | Public product and its private storage |

The standalone Cloudflare Preview channel has been retired. Main pushes no longer
deploy or verify a Preview Worker, and production release no longer requires a
successful Preview run. Use the self-host deployment path for the active hosted
environment.

Production releases still require Cloudflare credentials configured in the
`cloudflare-production` environment; removing the Preview channel does not
remove production Cloudflare authentication.

## Releasing to Production

Select the intended commit and use either a version tag or explicit dispatch.
[ADR 0057](adr/0057-release-channels-preview-and-production.md) explains the choice.


## Deploy, verify, recover

Production records its rollback target **before** deployment. It verifies the
serving shell/editor/analytics, MCP manifest, and stale-asset handling. If the
check fails, it restores the recorded Worker version, verifies that result,
and still fails the deployment run. Without a rollback target, it reports that
human intervention is required.

Recovery limitations:

- Reverting a Worker does not revert Durable Objects, D1, R2, KV, or their data
  migrations. Data changes require their own backup and recovery plan.
- A successful rollback check is not proof that every binding or executor
  returned to its prior state. Measure the serving version and behavior.
- A stale verification assertion can roll back correct behavior. Change the
  verification deliberately when its accepted contract changes.
- Worker recovery does not recover the separately operated simulator. Verify
  and restore its desired state independently.

Manual portable-release acceptance must also establish PWA installation and an
original import/place/wire/save/restart/restore/export journey. Record the
candidate and artifact hash; historical automated checklist ticks are not that
human evidence.

## Where the simulator runs

The Worker forwards to the configured operator gateway using
`SIMULATION_UPSTREAM_URL` and its secret `SIMULATION_UPSTREAM_TOKEN`.
The gateway validates its matching `SIMULATION_ACCESS_TOKEN`; that token never
enters the executor that runs authored SPICE. The container image is defined by
[`containers/ngspice/Dockerfile`](../containers/ngspice/Dockerfile).

[`containers/ngspice/host/compose.yaml`](../containers/ngspice/host/compose.yaml)
owns the gateway, untrusted executor, Tunnel, internal/egress networks, private
run volume, restart policy, and resource limits. The executor has a read-only
root, no platform credentials, no published host port, and no egress.
Only the gateway receives the bearer. The Tunnel connects the internal service
to its public hostname without an inbound host port.

The [Simulator host workflow](../.github/workflows/simulator-host.yml) deploys
the tracked host configuration. Verify its selected image and the measured
binary/model/startup identities against the
[hosted Profile](../containers/ngspice/hosted-sky130-profile.json), not just a
reachable health endpoint. The restart policy must recover a harness that exits
because it cannot prove a timed-out process is gone.

`metadata.environment.executor` describes the measured container environment;
`execution.target` identifies transport. A request naming an unconfigured
executor is refused, not redirected.

### Managed and direct transport

Preview uses `/api/simulation/runs`. Its durable control object owns owner-bound
admission, idempotency, leases, cancellation, and bounded run records. Queue
dispatch sends work to the operator host's declared single slot; R2 holds
immutable input/result artifacts. Account ownership is preferred; Preview can
issue an opaque HttpOnly anonymous capability. Capacity controls remain active
for both.

`/api/simulate` remains the direct/internal contract and the explicit
Production/local transport until managed bindings are promoted. A managed
failure never triggers fallback to it. The local host has no automatic
simulator or PDK discovery.

[Simulation execution](specs/simulation-execution.md) owns queue, deadline,
retention, result, and error contracts. Neither managed retention nor browser
comparison stores run history in the Project.

## External resource retirement

Removing repository configuration does not delete a deployed Worker or secret.
The retirement status of `interactive-circuit-maker-staging` and its
`STAGING_ACCESS_KEY` must be verified by an authorized operator before declaring
external cleanup complete. It is not an accepted third channel. Do not delete
Production data while cleaning up a retired deployment.

## When Production is broken

Restoring service outranks the normal delivery route while service is actually
degraded. Follow the incident exception in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md): use the
bounded recovery action needed, then record what was broken, what shipped, and
which checks were bypassed. Pushing main ordinarily deploys only Preview; it
does not by itself restore Production.
