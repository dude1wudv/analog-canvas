# Deployment

## Development and publication cadence

Use three stages so deployment work is paid per accepted batch rather than per
small edit:

| Stage      | Unit of work                                                               | Completion                                                                                                                 |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Local      | One bounded feature, fix, or improvement on the current local batch branch | Local feedback through `pnpm dev`, focused validation, and an explanatory local commit                                     |
| Preview    | At least 10 completed changes in one batch PR                              | Whole-batch delivery checks, both required PR checks against current `main`, one main merge, and hosted Preview acceptance |
| Production | A Preview-accepted candidate with release authorization                    | Version-tag or explicit-dispatch deployment and Production verification                                                    |

Ten changes means ten independently useful outcomes, not ten commits or files.
Supporting tests and follow-up repairs belong to their original change. Keep
the current working list and count in `plan/local-batch.md`, with the durable
intent and evidence in each commit and the batch PR. Continue the batch across
local tasks instead of opening a separate PR for each task. An explicit user
request may publish Preview earlier or hold the batch longer.

Local commits do not publish either site. A requested remote branch backup
also remains local-stage work. When the batch is ready, validate its combined
diff once for delivery and merge one PR; merging ten separate PRs would still
trigger repeated Preview deployments. Review the combined risk, including
interactions between otherwise small changes. Documentation-only work retains
the workflow's existing deployment exclusions.

The same immutable candidate receives one complete required CI pass. A current
branch merges directly after that pass; it does not enter a second merge-queue
run. If another change reaches `main` first, update the branch and rerun because
the candidate has changed. Preview selects hosted acceptance from the merged
paths. Ordinary editor work runs one published-MCP managed-engine smoke and one
GUI source journey in parallel. Agent, Simulation, simulator/netlist execution,
and deployment-boundary changes retain the complete qualification and product
journeys. Manual Preview runs are deep by default. Production promotes the
accepted bytes without rebuilding in either case.

Choose any release version while preparing the candidate for Preview. After
acceptance, Production publication is a separate release decision, covered by
the user's current or earlier authorization for that release. Neither the
change count nor Preview success automatically publishes Production. New local
work may accumulate in the next batch while the accepted Preview waits for a
Production release.

The existing deployment triggers below implement this cadence. See
[working rules](../AGENTS.md#three-stage-development-and-delivery) and
[validation timing](testing/README.md#local-iteration-and-batch-validation).

## Channels and data isolation

| Channel | Trigger and configuration | Data boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Self-hosted | `containers/self-host/deploy.sh <commit>` on the operator host | Persistent local data, secrets, and simulator services remain on the host |
| Production | `v*` tag or explicit commit dispatch; `.github/workflows/cloudflare.yml`; `wrangler.jsonc` | Public product and its private storage |

The standalone Cloudflare Preview channel has been retired. Main pushes no longer
deploy or verify a Preview Worker, and production release no longer requires a
successful Preview run. Use the self-host deployment path for the active hosted
environment.

Production releases still require Cloudflare credentials configured in the
`cloudflare-production` environment; removing the Preview channel does not
remove production Cloudflare authentication.

## Releasing to Production

Select the intended commit and use either a version tag or explicit dispatch.
[Deployment ADR](adr/deployment.md) records why this fork retired automatic channel routing.

## Deploy, verify, recover

Production records its rollback target **before** deployment. It verifies the
serving shell/editor/analytics, MCP manifest, and stale-asset handling. If a
post-deploy secret sync or verification fails, it restores the recorded Worker
version, verifies that result,
and still fails the deployment run. Without a rollback target, it reports that
human intervention is required.

Deep Preview acceptance runs the complete numerical, dual-engine, public
Agent/MCP, source-workspace GUI and private cross-Project journeys once; the
fast path runs only its two smoke journeys. Production verifies
that the served entry bytes match the accepted candidate, checks its public
routes and MCP manifest, creates and removes one lightweight Agent session, and
runs a baseline OP/TRAN/DC/Noise simulation smoke with Production bindings.
Preview's private cross-Project acceptance identity is never installed or
accepted on Production. The simulator token is required before deployment, and
each channel's managed queues and artifact bucket are reconciled independently.

Recovery limitations:

- Reverting a Worker does not revert Durable Objects, D1, R2, KV, or their data
  migrations. Data changes require their own backup and recovery plan.
- A successful rollback check is not proof that every binding or executor
  returned to its prior state. Measure the serving version and behavior.
- A stale verification assertion can roll back correct behavior. Change the
  verification deliberately when its accepted contract changes.
- Worker recovery does not recover the separately operated simulator. Verify
  and restore its desired state independently.

Manual portable-release acceptance must also establish PWA installation and an
original import/place/wire/save/restart/restore/export journey. Record the
candidate and artifact hash; historical automated checklist ticks are not that
human evidence.

## Where the simulator runs

The Worker forwards ngspice runs to the configured operator gateway using
`SIMULATION_UPSTREAM_URL` and its secret `SIMULATION_UPSTREAM_TOKEN`.
The gateway validates its matching `SIMULATION_ACCESS_TOKEN`; that token never
enters the executor that runs authored SPICE. The container image is defined by
[`containers/ngspice/Dockerfile`](../containers/ngspice/Dockerfile).

[`containers/ngspice/host/compose.yaml`](../containers/ngspice/host/compose.yaml)
owns the gateway, untrusted executor, Tunnel, internal/egress networks, private
run volume, restart policy, and resource limits. The executor has a read-only
root, no platform credentials, no published host port, and no egress.
Only the gateway receives the bearer. The Tunnel connects the internal service
to its public hostname without an inbound host port.

The [Simulator host workflow](../.github/workflows/simulator-host.yml) deploys
the tracked host configuration. Verify its selected image and the measured
binary/model/startup identities against the
[hosted Profile](../containers/ngspice/hosted-sky130-profile.json), not just a
reachable health endpoint. The restart policy must recover a harness that exits
because it cannot prove a timed-out process is gone.

`metadata.environment.executor` describes the measured container environment;
`execution.target` identifies transport. A request naming an unconfigured
executor is refused, not redirected.

Preview also routes the native VACASK Profile named by `VACASK_PROFILE_ID` to a
separate gateway at `VACASK_UPSTREAM_URL`, using the Preview secret
`VACASK_UPSTREAM_TOKEN`. The Simulator host workflow's `vacask-preview` action
builds that isolated candidate on the operator host from
[`containers/vacask/host/compose.yaml`](../containers/vacask/host/compose.yaml)
with its own Compose project, Tunnel and hostname, installs the secret, and
leaves the shared ngspice stack unchanged; it does not deploy Worker code.
Production configures no VACASK engine. The requested Profile selects the
engine, ngspice remains the default, and neither engine falls back to the other.

### Managed and direct transport

Both hosted channels use `/api/simulation/runs`. Each channel's durable control
object owns owner-bound admission, idempotency, leases, cancellation, and bounded run records. Queue
dispatch sends work to the operator host's declared single slot; R2 holds
immutable input/result artifacts. Account ownership is preferred; either channel can
issue an opaque HttpOnly anonymous capability. Capacity controls remain active
for both.

`/api/simulate` remains the direct/internal contract and the local transport.
A managed failure never triggers fallback to it. Production and Preview use
separate queues, control namespaces, and R2 buckets; both share the existing
ngspice operator gateway, which enforces its single execution slot. The local
host has no automatic simulator or PDK discovery.

[Simulation execution](specs/simulation-execution.md) owns queue, deadline,
retention, result, and error contracts. Neither managed retention nor browser
archives store run history in the Project.

## External resource retirement

Removing repository configuration does not delete a deployed Worker or secret.
The retirement status of `interactive-circuit-maker-staging` and its
`STAGING_ACCESS_KEY` must be verified by an authorized operator before declaring
external cleanup complete. It is not an accepted third channel. Do not delete
Production data while cleaning up a retired deployment.

## When Production is broken

Restoring service outranks the normal delivery route while service is actually
degraded. Follow the incident exception in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md): use the
bounded recovery action needed, then record what was broken, what shipped, and
which checks were bypassed. Pushing main ordinarily deploys only Preview; it
does not by itself restore Production.
