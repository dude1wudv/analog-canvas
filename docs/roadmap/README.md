# Remaining Product Work

Roadmaps contain unfinished outcomes and acceptance questions. Current behavior
belongs in [specifications](../specs/README.md); implementation and delivery
evidence belong in commits and pull requests. A file's existence or a module's
unit tests do not establish end-to-end completion.

Connectivity/export, portable release and hosted Agent rows are recurring
acceptance reviews, not missing feature implementations. Candidate receipts and
commits carry their evidence. Investigate concrete gaps revealed by those reviews;
do not recreate an already implemented subsystem.

## Net-join naming decision

The current direct-contact planner retires ordinary Net Label claims and their
annotations on the participating Base Nets when their resolved names differ,
then plans the merge. It does not remove formal Cell Pins or power-marker claims;
incompatible domains and remaining conflicts still reject atomically.
See [the current boundary](../specs/connectivity-and-routing.md#authoring-rules).

This is implemented behavior, not a settled general conflict policy. Removing
labels can also remove name-based connections to other physical components.
Review whether the current gesture adequately communicates that effect, and
cover local/global labels, repeated names elsewhere, formal terminals, power
markers and undo before changing or endorsing the broader policy. This review
does not authorize removing existing safety checks.

## Connectivity and naming acceptance

Use the current [connectivity](../specs/connectivity-and-routing.md),
[netlist](../specs/netlist-export.md), and
[diagnostic](../adr/0015-object-locator-and-diagnostic-envelope.md) contracts.
The acceptance review must cover:

- One occurrence-aware location path for search, trace, highlight, and check
  navigation, including two instances of the same child Cell.
- Shared resolved Route geometry for rendering, hit testing, attachment,
  dragging, diagnostics, and formal export; stable leg remapping through
  split, normalization, stretch, and deletion.
- Manual and Agent behavior for free ends, bends, loops, Junctions, groups,
  copy/paste, placement contacts, direct-pin separation, locked geometry, and
  route-bound annotations. Refactoring cannot discard a difficult corner.
- Wire cut → Base-Net partition → owner reconciliation → endpoint readiness,
  with undo/redo, reset, save/reopen, NoConnect, MOS bulk, imported provenance,
  local/global markers, and pin-to-pin contacts.
- Distinct disconnected local/global equal names; physical joins and subsequent
  cuts; project-wide canonical global spelling; dialect token collisions;
  explicit generic versus Cadence spelling; source hints after edits; Ground
  `0`; and owner-scoped Properties changes without topology mutation.
- Permutation-stable spelling, structural reparse of emitted netlists, and
  unchanged physical identity/ownership where only name projection changes.
- ERC versus advisory visual findings, explicit Check and Save invalidation,
  and the absence of editor-only overlays from formal exports.
- The [performance workloads](../specs/performance.md), especially avoiding
  repeated full-Document scans per Net and expensive pointer-move recomputation.

These are regression and closure obligations, not a new Net protocol, an
automatic rerouter, or a requirement to restore retired APIs.

## Execution discipline

Select a bounded target and its owner before implementation. Use the current
[working rules](../../AGENTS.md) and [test policy](../testing/README.md), rather
than copying gate commands into each roadmap. Use
[the phase template](phase.template.md) only when a genuinely staged outcome
needs a separate plan.

An unresolved requirement must be resolved, explicitly deferred, or retained
with an acceptance boundary. It must not disappear because an old checklist is
removed, nor be marked complete because a foundation module landed.
