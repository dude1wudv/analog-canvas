# ngspice ASCII rawfile fixtures

Seven rawfiles written by ngspice 46 sit beside the decks that produced them.
An eighth, `native-scalars-ac.raw`, is an explicitly synthetic arithmetic
shape fixture. Together they test the parser against real simulator output
while isolating one scalar-shape contract that ngspice does not emit directly.

Regenerate any of the seven simulator fixtures with
`ngspice -b <name>.deck.spi` from this directory.

## What each one is for

Every circuit here has a closed-form answer, so the assertions compare against
arithmetic rather than against a recorded number whose only authority is that
the parser once produced it.

**`divider-op`** — 1 V across two 1 kΩ resistors. `v(mid)` is 0.5 V exactly,
and the fixture holds `5.000000000000000e-01`. One plot, one point: the
smallest shape the format takes.

**`divider-op-listed`** — the same divider, but its deck names the vectors
to write (`write … v(in) v(mid) i(v1)`), which is how a compiled simulation
setup asks for exactly its probes. ngspice writes the plot's scale before the
listed vectors, and an operating-point plot's scale is its first vector, so
`v(in)` appears twice in `Variables:` with one value. The reader must report
the probe once; the fixture exists so that echo is tested against a file the
simulator wrote.

**`divider-dc`** — the same divider swept from 0 V to 1.5 V. Its values are
recorded from the pinned Preview operator host (ngspice 46) on 2026-09-06,
using the adjacent deck. They satisfy `v(mid) = v(in)/2`. The ASCII scale is
`v(v-sweep)`, not the bare `v-sweep` formerly assumed by reconstructed data.
Environment fingerprint: `33c245e5df6dc12077b6a2e4ebf308777b0e9014fe9bfdafc3285c614688561d`.

**`rc-ac`** — R = 1 kΩ, C = 1 µF, so H(f) = 1/(1 + jf/f_c) with
f_c = 1/(2π·RC) = 159.1549 Hz. Every one of the 17 points can be asserted
against that expression, not just a point near the corner. Measured agreement
across the sweep:

- magnitude, worst relative deviation: **6.5e-16**
- phase, worst deviation: **1.4e-14 degrees**

That is machine precision, so this file supports a tolerance near 1e-12. It is
also the only fixture with `Flags: complex`, where each value is
`real,imaginary`.

**`rc-tran`** — the same network's step response, τ = 1 ms, so
v_out(t) = 1 − e^(−t/τ). Worst relative deviation across the run is
**4.8e-4**, at the earliest points where the ideal value is still near zero
and the integrator has the least to work with; 1e-3 is a tolerance that holds
with margin. The timesteps are chosen by ngspice and range from 1e-11 to
8e-05 — a factor of eight million — so a parser that assumes a uniform grid
will read this file and be wrong about when everything happened.

**`resistor-noise-ngspice46`** — two 1 kΩ resistors leave 500 Ω of
small-signal resistance at the output. At 27 °C its thermal-noise density is
`sqrt(4 k T R)`, and the 0.5 V/V signal gain makes input-referred voltage noise
twice the output density. Integrating the constant density from 10 Hz to
1 kHz multiplies it by `sqrt(990 Hz)`.

**`resistor-current-noise-ngspice46`** — the same passive network driven by
an independent current source. It proves ngspice declares input-referred
density as `current-density` and the integrated input total as current, while
the output remains voltage-referred. Both noise fixtures were generated with
the official ngspice 46 Windows console build. The command and two-plot write
sequence follow the official manual: https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/docs/ngspice-46-manual.pdf

**`native-scalars-ac`** — a synthetic complex AC record that keeps one swept
vector beside scalar-shaped values. It exists only to exercise scalar result
classification and arithmetic; unlike the seven simulator fixtures, it has no
generating deck and is not evidence of ngspice output syntax.

## One thing the format does that the header does not announce

A point's values are one indexed line followed by one line per remaining
variable, and then **a blank line** before the next point. Splitting on a
fixed line stride works on some files and silently misreads others. Split on
the blank line, and check the recovered point count against `No. Points`.
