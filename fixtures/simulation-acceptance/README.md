# Simulation acceptance Projects

The existing `hosted-*.json` acceptance manifests and `ota-5t*` inputs are
retained as service-level regression fixtures. They are not the human-importable
native Code examples below and are not silently replaced.

## Native Code Project examples

From the repository root, build workspace packages, then run:

```powershell
node scripts/build-native-simulation-examples.mjs
```

The output directory is `output/native-simulation-examples`. Import one of its
five `.icproj.json` files with File → Import, open Code,
and select an experiment folder. Execution requires its declared native candidate
Profile, which Preview routes to its separate VACASK gateway; Production
configures no VACASK engine. Each includes its Canvas circuits and
source files; no file from the author's Downloads directory is needed.

| Project                 | Experiments | Electrical intent                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `01-rc-filters`         | 4           | Low/high-pass AC and step response; 10 kΩ, 10 nF, 1.59155 kHz cutoff               |
| `02-rlc-filter`         | 3           | AC plus transient at under/critical/over damping; 10 mH, 100 nF                    |
| `03-common-source`      | 4           | SKY130 bias/device OP, DC transfer, AC, small/large-signal native loop             |
| `04-sky130-ota`         | 8           | Preserved user OTA, OP/DC, TT/FF/SS AC, open-loop transient, noise, unity feedback |
| `05-sky130-ota-library` | 12          | Library OTA lab: OP/DC, TT/FF/SS/FS/SF AC, pulse and sine transient, noise         |

The exported Projects are the bundled `apps/editor/src/examples/` assets; their
native recipe sources and acceptance notes live in separate `netlists/native-*/`
directories. The OTA source is a
canonicalized copy of the user-supplied Five-Transistor OTA Project, with its six-transistor
drawing (five core devices plus bias device) and model parameters preserved.
The closed-loop experiment binds the same DUT with an explicit text testbench;
the open-loop Canvas testbench is not misrepresented as a feedback schematic.

Experiments use native VACASK source and config v2. Every folder, RC/RLC
included, declares `vacask-sky130-candidate`.
Native programs own temperature, model selection, saves, analyses and loops;
editable Python postprocessors report measurements and derived plots through the
existing result contract. This observed candidate Profile is **not a qualified
production environment**. Models are the declared, digest-addressed SKY130
dependency with the approved BSIM4 4.8.3 upgrade, not illustrative substitutes.
Temperature is 27 °C; OTA AC covers TT, FF and SS (plus FS and SF in the
Library OTA), and the other MOS analyses use TT. This is representative
coverage, not a claim that every product feature, process corner or analog
specification is tested.

## Native numerical checks and live MCP runner

`run-native-simulation-examples.mjs` requires an explicit candidate origin,
a digest-checked packaged MCP entry and independently expected native environment
metadata for every selected Profile. It refuses the known Production/shared
Preview origins. This does **not** prove resource isolation: establish M1's
executor/storage/auth boundary separately before running against a cloud origin.
The runner opens fresh temporary browser contexts, imports through
the GUI, obtains a fresh full-authority claim for each temporary Project, and
runs prepare/start/read batch and artifact export through stdio MCP. It does
not use a user's open browser Project, restart their MCP, publish a Project,
call simulation HTTP endpoints directly, or substitute mocked simulator data.

Build the candidate Editor and packaged MCP using the existing build/package
commands. Deploy only to the authorized isolated target. Preserve the package's
`bin/analog-canvas-mcp.mjs` and adjacent `package.json`; do not substitute an
unbundled `dist/main.js`. The runner checks served Editor entry bytes against
the local build and MCP initialize version against the supplied package.
For example (paths and digests are explicit acceptance inputs, not defaults):

```powershell
node scripts/run-native-simulation-examples.mjs output/native-simulation-examples --url https://isolated-candidate.example --mcp-bundle output/mcp/analog-canvas-mcp-v<version>/bin/analog-canvas-mcp.mjs --mcp-sha256 <expected-bundle-sha256> --environment <native-environment.json>
node scripts/analyze-native-simulation-examples.mjs output/native-simulation-examples
```

Each environment file is the existing environment metadata object (including
`profileId`, `simulator` with its binary digest, and `fingerprint`), obtained from
the independently prepared candidate runtime—not copied from the result being
accepted. `--project <exact-slug>` selects one entire Project for focused work;
the final numerical analyzer requires all 31 experiments: the 19 starters plus
the 12 Library OTA experiments. The exporter includes all five Projects by
default; `--project ota-library` selects the Library OTA during focused export.
All use `vacask-sky130-candidate`; corner selection lives in native include
sections, not a separate runtime identity.
The output `results/` must not already exist: use a freshly generated export
directory for another attempt, keeping earlier failure evidence.

The runner checks advertised native collection, batch capacity and model dependency
digests before submission. It downloads complete artifacts with original nested
paths, checks the expected runtime and executed source, and exports every non-OP
plot from complete `result.json` arrays. One failed run/export cannot become a
passing Project receipt; other available evidence is still collected. An active
batch is cancelled on interrupted acceptance before disconnecting its MCP.
Runner receipts cover this GUI/MCP batch only, not full M6 or model qualification.

For current local native execution, `containers/vacask/starter-journey.test.mjs`
runs the actual Prepare/Run/Read/File service against a configured VACASK binary,
modules, Python and matching model artifacts. Set `ICM_VACASK_STARTER_SANITY=1`
when running the **whole** file to additionally check all 31 experiments together.
Set `ICM_VACASK_SECTIONED_MANIFEST` to the generated model package manifest;
the binary, modules and Python paths must also be explicitly configured:

```powershell
$env:ICM_VACASK_STARTER_SANITY = "1"
pnpm test:local containers/vacask/starter-journey.test.mjs
```

Missing runtime/model configuration cannot produce a passing aggregate. Optional
`ICM_VACASK_EVIDENCE_DIR` retains per-run result artifacts and a fresh
`starter-sanity-*/acceptance.json`. This is local service/numerical evidence, not
GUI/MCP or isolated-cloud acceptance. The migration does not require numerical
equivalence to an ngspice reference; see the
[native acceptance decision](../../docs/roadmap/vacask-migration.md#environment-and-electrical-acceptance).

`scripts/lib/native-example-acceptance.mjs` supplies those same checks to the
offline `analyze-native-simulation-examples.mjs` command. The CLI additionally
requires complete live receipts, hashed nested `executed/` and `raw/` artifacts,
matching Profile-projected Prepare input (using retained receipt capabilities)
and exported plots. Its output is exclusive-create;
existing acceptance evidence is not overwritten. Historical runner output with
flattened paths or absent exports is not accepted native evidence.

`results/<project>/<folder>/` contains immutable rawfiles, logs, result JSON,
native measurements, CSV exports and evidence manifests with verified SHA-256
digests. Multi-group plot exports are ZIPs. `mcp-export.icproj.json` is a
round-trip export, not a container for run history. Run history is intentionally
separate from portable Projects: an importing user must run again to populate
Results. The analyzer checks complete finite native arrays and measurements,
RC/RLC theory, the common-source load line and small-signal model, and nominal
OTA bias/feedback behavior, complex phase unwrapping, small/large-signal harmonic
distortion, and integrated noise recomputed from the returned PSD. Noise integration
is explicitly `trapezoidal-psd`, not ngspice's per-source integration. Existing
electrical sanity checks protect native mapping and result handling; they do not
establish cross-simulator equivalence, which is not an M2 release requirement.
Treat missing results or failed checks as incomplete
acceptance, even if a simulator process exited successfully.

The generator contract test checks importable structure, clean diagnostics,
source-only experiment configuration and preservation of the user's OTA DUT:

```powershell
pnpm test:local scripts/build-native-simulation-examples.test.mjs
```
