 * The deploy pipeline's own contract.

 * On 2026-09-01 a bad deploy served 500s for twenty minutes. The pipeline
 * DETECTED it — six failed verification attempts — went red, and left
 * production broken, because detection was all it could do. These assertions
 * exist so the recovery path cannot quietly disappear the way it was quietly
 * absent, and because this file is one nobody exercises until the day it
