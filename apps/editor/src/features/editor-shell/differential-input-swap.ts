/**
 * Every polarity-marked amplifier ships beside an input-swapped sibling that
 * differs only in where its two marks sit and which input pin each one names.
 * Swapping inputs exchanges the two Symbols.
 *
 * Reflecting the Instance top to bottom would be shorter, and it is what this
 * used to do, but a reflection cannot tell the marks apart from the rest of
 * the drawing: it turns a comparator's transfer-characteristic glyph upside
 * down, exchanges a differential amplifier's outputs along with its inputs,
 * and flips the reference designator with the body. The exchange touches
 * exactly what the action names, and the pin names are identical on both
 * sides, so every attached Net survives it.
