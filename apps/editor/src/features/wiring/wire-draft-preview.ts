 * because the planner would drop them anyway: a contact joins the wire only
 * when it lies ON the drawn path, and every vertex `compileWireDraft`
 * produces lies inside the box spanned by the two ends and the authored
 * steps — an inserted elbow is a corner BETWEEN two of those points, and both
 * the doubled-back cancellation and the normalizer only ever remove vertices.
 *
 * The narrowing is here, in the one function both the preview and the commit
 * call, rather than in either of them: a filter applied on one side only is
 * how the two drifted apart in the first place. It matters because the
 * preview runs on every pointer move, where the commit runs once. Measured
 * over 6000 visible pins: an ordinary short hop went from 6.9ms a move to
 * 0.2ms. A wire dragged corner to corner across the whole sheet spans every
 * pin and still costs about 10ms a move, because a box that contains
 * everything excludes nothing; tightening that further means reasoning about
 * where each routing mode may put an elbow, which is the kind of filter that
 * agrees with the planner until it quietly does not.
