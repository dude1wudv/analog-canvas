# Simulation starters

The four `simulation-*.icproj.json` files are complete source-Code Projects,
exposed only in the Simulation start area. They are not Gallery registrations.
They were imported from the four user-reviewed Downloads exports on 2026-09-13;
schematics, parameters and executable source were preserved. Only teaching
comments were added. Run history is not part of these assets.

The import boundary parses an isolated copy and applies the same conductor and
legacy Ground-marker normalization as File/Open. It assigns a new Project id,
asks about whole-Project replacement, then uses the normal unsaved-work guard.
Cancelling either prompt must leave the original Project installed. Never infer
that a Project is empty from its currently visible Cell.

The starter programs cover 4 RC, 3 RLC, 4 common-source and 8 OTA experiments.
All 19 starter experiments are native VACASK; see
[RC acceptance](../../../../netlists/native-rc-filters/README.md),
[RLC acceptance](../../../../netlists/native-rlc-filter/README.md) and
[common-source acceptance](../../../../netlists/native-common-source/README.md) and
[OTA acceptance](../../../../netlists/native-ota/README.md).
Their Canvas data is preserved; only executable source, report files and requested
Profile change. AC exposes a complex Gain trace; the workspace shows Specs and
Console, and CSV keeps real/imaginary data for external dB/phase views.
Historical numerical acceptance remains separate from these source migrations:
compiling a native program does not establish equivalence to the old simulator.
The saved local `output/native-simulation-examples` evidence is not a golden
inside the bundled Projects. The separate twelve-folder
[Library OTA lab](../../../../netlists/native-ota-library/README.md) is now explicitly
converted too; its historical source is retained for import tests. Other user
experiments are not implicitly converted by either asset migration.

The subsequent common-source conversion requests an explicit BSIM4 4.8.3 TT
candidate; this is a model-version upgrade requiring separate qualification,
not a declaration of equality to the original ngspice model. Four missing GND
claims were materialized with the existing File/Open normalization so direct
compilation has the same electrical input as the GUI. Geometry is unchanged.

OTA experiment 08 intentionally uses Canvas only for the `ota_5t` subcircuit.
Its sources, load and feedback are in `testbench.spice`; the visible open-loop
Canvas Testbench is not part of that experiment. This is a supported mixed
workflow, not a requirement to draw a second Testbench.

New experiment comments are created once, then owned by the user. Source context
uses the live draft include graph and calls subcircuit references “sources”, not
proof of instantiation. Dynamic source loading or broken includes are marked for
Prepare verification. Code parameter overrides do not rewrite Canvas values.

## Export reviewed examples

After building the Agent adapter/exporter dependencies, use a fresh or empty
output directory:

```sh
pnpm --filter @icm/agent-adapter... --filter @icm/exporters... build
node scripts/build-native-simulation-examples.mjs output/passive-candidate --project rc --project rlc
```

This exports the bundled Projects without reconstructing their schematics or
maintaining a duplicate set of programs. It writes SVG/PNG/inspection artifacts,
authored files under `source/`, and actual native compiled files under `prepared/`.
Existing evidence is never overwritten. `manifest.json` is written last with
`compiled-not-executed`; Profile identity belongs to each folder. Compilation
does not run or qualify an environment, and no cloud endpoint is contacted.

Omitting `--project` selects all five Projects and all 31 folders: the four
starters plus the twelve-folder Library OTA lab (`--project ota-library`,
exported from `five-transistor-ota-sky130.icproj.json`). Every selected
folder must compile before any output is written; failures are not silently
skipped. The full starter-library test remains an acceptance obligation alongside
focused export tests. The former optional external OTA input is retired; the reviewed
bundled OTA is the single source, as for the other examples. This command does
not authorize using the older fixed-Preview remote runner for VACASK acceptance.
