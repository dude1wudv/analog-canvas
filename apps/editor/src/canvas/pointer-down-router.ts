/**
 * Who owns one press on the canvas.
 *
 * A press used to be settled by five places at once — the background gesture
 * classifier, this capture-phase dispatcher, three element-level React
 * handlers, and the wire controller — and correctness rested on the capture
 * phase calling `stopPropagation` before the target phase could run. Every
 * fix in this layer had to re-derive the whole order from scratch, which is
 * why #407, #436, #438 and #490 all landed here within three weeks.
 *
 * Ownership is now decided in one pure function. It reads facts and returns
 * an action; it touches no DOM, starts no drag, and knows nothing about
 * React. The caller executes the action, and every branch below is a case a
 * test can name.
