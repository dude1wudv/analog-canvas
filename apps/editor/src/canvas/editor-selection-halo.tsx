 * A selected component is marked by tracing its own artwork, never by boxing

 * scene with a thick accent stroke, so every line of the component reads as
 * lit while the component itself is drawn on top exactly as before —
 * including a per-instance colour override, which a recolour would have
 * destroyed and this leaves untouched.
 *
 * A box would also claim an extent the drawing does not occupy: an
 * axis-aligned box around a rotated device, or around a symbol that is mostly
 * whitespace, is far larger than the lines it contains, and in a dense
 * schematic it overlaps neighbours that are not selected.
