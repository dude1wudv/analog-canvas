// The container's whole job: accept a deck, run ngspice on it, return what
// ngspice said. It decides nothing about the circuit.
//
// It does decide how that deck is allowed to run, and that is the harder
// half. What executes here is somebody else's SPICE: a `.control` block is a
// small language with file access, and the author of a deck is not the
// operator of this container. So the run is boxed in on every side that can
// be boxed in from inside the process — a fresh directory per run that is
// also the only writable place the simulator can see, an environment built
// from nothing rather than inherited, one job at a time, a deadline that
// kills the whole process group rather than one pid, and a cap on every byte
// that comes back. The container's own answer for what it cannot enforce
// from in here — who it runs as, and what the model tree permits — is in the
// Dockerfile beside this file.
//
// A container wakes with a fresh disk and sleeps after ten idle minutes, so
// every run writes its deck, reads its output, and leaves nothing behind
// that a later run could depend on.
