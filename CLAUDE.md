# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Analog Canvas is a local-first, connectivity-aware schematic editor for the
web: hierarchical Cells, structural SPICE/Spectre interchange, private Cloud
Projects, a Community Gallery, formal SVG/PDF/PNG and netlist export, and
analog simulation orchestration. Supported native primitives and qualified
device models run through the selected executor Profile — ngspice, plus
VACASK as a second engine configured only on Preview; unsupported blocks are
diagnosed. Humans and authorized Agents share the typed Edit Engine.
[Product architecture](docs/overall-product-plan.md) owns the complete boundary;
[simulation](docs/specs/simulation.md) owns saved intent and execution contracts.

- pnpm workspace: `apps/*` and `packages/*` (21 projects, all scoped `@icm/*`). The private root package `interactive-circuit-maker` carries the product version; [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) records user-facing changes per release.
- Node >= 24, pnpm >= 11.16 (`packageManager: pnpm@11.16.0`), ESM only. Pinned toolchain: TypeScript 7, Vite 8, Vitest 4, Playwright 1.62, Prettier 3.
- License: AGPL-3.0-only ([LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md)).

```

Unit tests sit beside their implementation under one root `vitest.config.ts`: `*.test.ts(x)` in `apps/`, `packages/`, and `worker/`, and `*.test.mjs` in `scripts/` and `containers/` (exception: `packages/agent-routing/test/`). Workspace packages have no test scripts of their own. Playwright specs live in `apps/editor/e2e/`; the config auto-starts a Vite server on `127.0.0.1:4173` (`ICM_E2E_PORT`), reuses a running one unless `CI` or `ICM_E2E_ISOLATED=1` is set, and drives system Chrome locally (`PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH` overrides).

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) plans validation from the changed paths (`scripts/ci-plan.mjs`, `config/validation-gates.json`). The two required PR checks are `Core contracts` (`ci:static`, `ci:unit`, `release:verify`) and `Browser tests` (only the specs mapped to the PR's paths, or a small fallback); nightly and manual runs perform a four-shard full browser audit.

### Generated artifacts

Component data flows one way. `packages/components/definitions/<symbol-id>.json` (symbol + electrical + catalog, indexed by `packages/components/catalog.json`) is the authoring source; see [packages/components/README.md](packages/components/README.md). Reference-derived geometry inside those files is written by family generators from `fixtures/visual-reference/razavi-reference-v1/` — change the generator or its evidence, not the JSON.

Never hand-edit these; each generator has a paired `:check` drift gate:

- `packages/devices/src/components.generated.ts` and `packages/symbols/src/{expanded-components,razavi-catalog}.generated.ts` (`components:generate`, also part of `symbols:razavi`), `packages/derived/src/razavi-peripheral-geometry.generated.ts` (`symbols:razavi-peripherals`), `packages/agent-adapter/src/agent-authoring-catalog.generated.ts` (`agent-kit:catalog`), `apps/mcp-server/src/resources.generated.ts` (`agent-docs:generate`).
- `fixtures/agent-api/*` (`agent-api:artifacts`), `fixtures/visual-golden/*` (`visual:golden`), `fixtures/exports/*` (`export:golden`), `fixtures/editor-production-smoke/report.json` (`test:production-smoke`), and the PWA icons in `apps/editor/public/` (`pwa:icons`).

Regeneration order when symbol data changes:

1. Base family generators: `symbols:razavi-{mos,peripherals,inductor,opamp,common,logic,buffer-dff,delay-cell,zener}`, `symbols:converters`.
2. Derived siblings: `symbols:lettered-amps`, then `symbols:swap-inputs`.
3. `pnpm symbols:razavi` — the signal-flow and magnetic families, then the component-library projections, Razavi catalog, Agent catalog, and MCP resources. After editing definitions by hand, `pnpm components:generate` is enough.
4. `pnpm build`, then as affected: `agent-api:artifacts`, `pwa:icons`, `visual:golden`, `export:golden`.

`ci:static` enforces `components:check` and `agent-kit:catalog:check`; `symbols:razavi:check` covers the Razavi chain including MCP resources; `apps/mcp-server/src/resources.test.ts` fails when MCP resources are stale; release verification runs the golden, icon, and smoke checks.

## Required workflow (AGENTS.md)

[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) defines the mandatory working discipline; read it before working. Summary:

- **Three stages**: (1) local iteration on a batch branch; (2) one reviewed merge to `main`, which does not publish the active self-hosted service; (3) an explicitly authorized deployment of a fixed commit with `containers/self-host/deploy.sh`. The Cloudflare Preview channel is retired, and Cloudflare Production remains tag/dispatch-only. Track an in-progress batch in the untracked `plan/local-batch.md`.
- **Before editing tracked files**: run `git status --short --branch` and audit dirty paths by ownership (unrelated dirty files don't block; overlapping or unclear ones do). Know the target's goal, owned paths, and shared contracts; `plan/` is the untracked scratch area.
- **Test impact**: a commit that changes implementation code — `.ts/.tsx/.js/.mjs` under `apps/*/src/`, `packages/*/src/`, `worker/`, or `scripts/` — carries a `Test-Impact:` trailer: `tests-updated`, or `no-test-change — <evidence>`. `pnpm test:impact -- --base <ref>` cross-checks the claim against the diff and CI runs the same check.
- **Validation is risk-proportional**: run the smallest deterministic checks that cover the change (documentation-only → `pnpm docs:check`); full suites only when breadth, risk, or policy justifies them. Every target closes with `git diff --check`, `git status --short --branch`, and a commit message that stands alone: what changed, why, the validation and chosen gates, and the trailer.
- **Mainline delivery gate**: follow the selected gates and the required `Core contracts` and `Browser tests` checks in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md); [deployment](docs/deployment.md) owns Preview/Production promotion.
- **Circuit assets**: one circuit per `netlists/<name>/` directory; `.subckt` interfaces and instance pin order are shared contracts (check every caller before changing); never claim electrical correctness from syntax inspection alone; never silently replace vendor/foundry model data with illustrative values.
- Commit subjects use conventional scopes: `feat(editor):`, `fix(netlist):`, `docs(specs):`, `test(editor):`.

## Architecture

### Repository layout

- `apps/` — `editor`, `local-host`, `mcp-server` (below).
- `packages/` — the `@icm/*` libraries below, plus the `components/` data directory.
- `worker/` — the Cloudflare Worker (not a workspace package; its tests run in the root Vitest).
- `containers/` — simulator images and host tooling: `ngspice/` (gateway, run supervisor, rawfile collector, hosted SKY130 profile), `vacask/` (HTTP executor, job runner, model symbols), and `simulation/run-local-files.mjs`.
- `netlists/<circuit>/` — one simulation example or acceptance circuit per directory (native ngspice, SKY130, VACASK, held-out Phase 9 cases).
- `fixtures/` — cross-package test data: Agent API artifacts, the Razavi visual reference, visual and export goldens, ngspice rawfiles, legacy and Gallery-redline Projects, SPICE baselines and vendor decks, simulation acceptance.
- `scripts/` — generators, gate planning (`gate-plan.mjs`, `gate-run.mjs`, `ci-plan.mjs`, `lib/`), packaging, release/Preview smoke, and simulation acceptance, with `*.test.mjs` beside them.
- `tools/` — Python PDF-vector extraction and Razavi calibration tooling.
- `config/` — the validation-gate catalog, the MCP distribution declaration (`agent-mcp-distribution.json` holds the published MCP version), and the VACASK Preview environment.
- `skills/circuit-layout/` — the repo-local Agent layout skill. `references/` — pinned research-only reference repositories (fetched into the ignored `.reference-src/`, never imported or bundled).
- `docs/` — product plan, ADRs, specs, user and Agent guides, roadmap, testing, deployment. `.github/workflows/` — `ci`, `cloudflare` (tag/dispatch-only Production), `container`, `simulator-host`, `mcp-release`.

### Package layering

Dependencies flow strictly downward and pnpm's topological order is the only build order. `@icm/math-typesetting` and `@icm/spice-run` are leaves; `@icm/model` (which depends only on math-typesetting) is the root every domain package shares. Roughly bottom-up:

- `@icm/math-typesetting` — MathJax TeX → SVG formula typesetting with a fixed profile and bounded cache; used by model, derived, render-svg, and the editor.
- `@icm/model` — Zod schemas and branded IDs for the persisted Project (documents, instances, nets, routes, annotations, rich text, geometry, simulation source folders). The single source of type truth.
- `@icm/devices` — built-in device descriptor registry (projected from component definitions): device facts, reference-designator rules, parameter validation.
- `@icm/symbols` — symbol semantics and artwork (projected from component definitions): built-in symbols, generated Razavi catalog, pin anchors.
- `packages/components/` — not a workspace package: the canonical component definitions and catalog behind `devices` and `symbols`.
- `@icm/derived` — pure read-only projections over the model: connectivity index, Base/Logical Nets, ERC/diagnostics, anchors, label placement, resolved route geometry, search.
- `@icm/spice` — structural SPICE import (lexer, dialects, expression eval → transient Circuit IR) and the pure SPICE → Spectre converter behind `POST /api/netlist/convert`; Node-only `./node` entry.
- `@icm/spice-run` — deck and environment-Profile contracts; ngspice and VACASK rawfile/result interpretation.
- `@icm/netlist` — deterministic design-netlist extraction and printing (transient DesignNetlistIR), formal cell-interface derivation, and simulation source compilation.
- `@icm/project-protocol` — bounded `.icproj.json` parse/migrate/serialize compatibility boundary with load diagnostics.
- `@icm/edit-engine` — **the sole mutation boundary**: typed schematic edits, dry-run/commit transactions, revision checks, undo history, and planners (routing, power/named nets, references, hierarchy). Both the GUI and the Agent go through it.
- `@icm/render-svg` — persisted document → formal SVG scene, including rich-text and formula layout.
- `@icm/exporters` — SVG/PNG/PDF artifacts; browser entries (`./browser`, `./browser-raster`, `./browser-pdf`) plus Node-only `./node` (resvg, pdf-lib).
- `@icm/timing-simulation` — deterministic digital event simulation (clock, gates, flip-flops; four-state values; integer picoseconds). Its editor UI is experimental and hidden in Cloudflare production builds.
- `@icm/simulation-service` — shared preparation, managed run lifecycle, measurements and Spec results, outputs, and File artifacts (`./contract`, `./files`).
- `@icm/agent-adapter` — Agent API 3.0 surface: the Circuit endpoint's four operations (capabilities/snapshot/transact/render) plus the File, Simulation, and Project resources; envelopes, zod+OpenAPI schemas, session state, browser-safe host; `./loopback` and the HTTP Agent Kit payload `./kit`.
- `@icm/agent-client` — Node-only Agent-side client: HTTP/session clients, credential store, snapshot cache.
- `@icm/agent-routing` — Agent-local transient RouteGraph → typed-edit expander. Agent rationale: these types never enter the API schema or persisted model; Agent-side scaffolding with no in-repo importers.
- `@icm/platform-node` — Node filesystem storage/recovery adapters; no in-repo importers.
- `apps/editor` — the React/SVG editor and installable PWA, plus the Gallery, account, and moderation surfaces. `analytics/` is the self-contained first-party analytics module; `dev/` holds the Vite dev-server plugins (local Agent relay, netlist conversion, local simulation).
- `apps/local-host` — loopback-only static host for `apps/editor/dist` with a local simulation transport seam (`bin: interactive-circuit-maker`; its only dependency is `@icm/spice-run`).
- `apps/mcp-server` — stdio MCP server (`bin: analog-canvas-mcp`) over `agent-client`, with generated doc resources. Release packaging (`scripts/package-mcp.mjs`) bundles it with Vite and takes the version from `config/agent-mcp-distribution.json`, not from its `package.json`.
- `worker/` — self-hosted workerd Worker and the Cloudflare production Worker. Production deploys from a `v*` tag or an explicit commit via `.github/workflows/cloudflare.yml`; the former Cloudflare Preview channel has been retired.

The retired Cloudflare Preview channel is no longer an active deployment target. Use the self-hosted editor URL and the operator-host deployment procedure for active Agent/simulation work.

For local development, `pnpm dev` starts the real Agent relay on first use through the editor's own `/api/agent/` routes, including its WebSocket. No separate Worker process needs to be launched manually. Use the loopback origin in the copied message from an Agent on the same computer. The local relay does not start cloud account, Gallery, or hosted simulation services, and restarting the development server ends its in-memory sessions.

An unconfigured production build still keeps the Agent UI dormant. Explicit deployment flags control availability without changing the API or MCP contract.

### Build mechanics

- Packages and `apps/{local-host,mcp-server}` build with plain `tsc`; only `apps/editor` uses Vite (MCP release packaging also bundles with Vite). Build order comes solely from pnpm topological ordering (no `tsc -b` project references).
- The `development` package-export condition maps `@icm/*` to `src/*.ts` (every package except `platform-node`), so the browser code served by Vite dev and Vitest run from source with no build. Node consumers (`scripts/*.mjs`, mcp-server, packaged release) resolve `dist/` — that is why those npm scripts are prefixed with a build. The Vite config loader and the Node-side Playwright specs also resolve `dist/`, so a fresh checkout needs `pnpm build` before `pnpm dev` or browser tests; `ci:e2e` compiles every non-editor workspace project first.
- `pnpm typecheck` (`tsconfig.check.json`) maps `@icm/*` straight to source and covers `apps/`, `packages/`, and `worker/`, including the `*.test.ts` files that package builds exclude.

### Editor internals

[apps/editor/src/README.md](apps/editor/src/README.md) is the normative layering doc. Dependency direction: `main → app → features/components/document/interaction/canvas → packages/*`. Each directory under `features/` (clipboard, component-insert, drafting, editor-shell, hierarchy, instance-display, netlist-export, project-code, properties, search, selection, simulation, text-editing, wiring) owns its pure proposals, view adapters, and tests; other source roots include `agent/`, `commands/`, `demos/` (test fixtures), `deployment/` (public UI flags), `examples/` (bundled starter Projects), `presentation/`, `snap/`, and `styles/`. Rules: feature and infrastructure modules never import `app/App.tsx`; pure proposal/reducer/geometry modules never import React components; avoid cross-feature imports — the tree already contains many, so do not treat them as precedent; promote a genuinely shared primitive to `canvas/`, `document/`, `interaction/`, `snap/`, or a workspace package instead; no barrel files added just to shorten imports; stylesheets load from the route-level entries in `styles/`, never from a lazy component.

### Core invariants

- Connectivity is explicit: net membership, Junctions, formal cell terminals, and typed Instance terminals are electrical facts. Drawing geometry never silently creates a connection; a Crossing is not a Junction — ambiguous intersections are rejected, not guessed.
- Routes are visible geometry only; they may stretch during movement without changing logical connectivity.
- An Agent reads a complete Snapshot and submits typed edits with an expected revision. There is no second command language and no DOM-automation mutation path.
- Canonical Project content follows the file-format spec; Cloud Save, portable export, browser recovery, and execution retention have distinct ownership.
- The Razavi reference manifest (`fixtures/visual-reference/razavi-reference-v1/`) is the sole visual authority.

## Documentation authority

Specifications own accepted contracts; topic ADRs explain reasons and link to specs. When code and a spec disagree, inspect behavior and tests, preserve deliberate coherent behavior, and surface unresolved choices. Follow `docs/README.md`; do not treat an old ADR as a competing rule or silently endorse an implementation accident.

- Default reading set for product work: [docs/README.md](docs/README.md#contributor-reading-order).
- Test layers and contract ownership: [docs/testing/README.md](docs/testing/README.md) and its contract matrix.
- Agent schematic-layout workflow: [docs/agent/workflow.md](docs/agent/workflow.md) and the repo-local [skills/circuit-layout/SKILL.md](skills/circuit-layout/SKILL.md).
- `pnpm docs:check` validates links in `README.md` and `docs/`, and requires every ADR and spec to be indexed with a `Status:` line (specs also need an owner line). `format:check` skips Markdown, though most docs are Prettier-formatted.
- Some docs are test-pinned: `packages/{model,edit-engine,agent-adapter}/src/protocol-documentation.test.ts` read spec and plan text (for example the current Project schema version), and `apps/mcp-server/src/resources.test.ts` requires `resources.generated.ts` to match the docs listed in `docs/agent/distribution.json` — after editing one of those docs, run `pnpm agent-docs:generate`.
