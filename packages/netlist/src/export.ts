 * a floating node rather than a circuit: the drawing is unfinished, which is
 * a different thing from a missing model or value, which blocks export with a
 * located diagnostic.
 * The legitimate single-pin nodes are excluded by construction — a Cell port
 * carries its node outward to whoever instantiates the Cell, a global net is
 * shared with the rest of the design, an explicit NoConnect is the author
 * saying that this pin ends here on purpose, and a node somebody named (or
 * that a SPICE import named) is a declared signal rather than leftover
 * geometry. What remains is an unnamed node one pin reaches: a wire that was
 * drawn and never finished.
 *
 * This is deliberately the export's own gate rather than an extraction error:
 * the analyzer also serves formal-interface derivation and simulation-source
 * compilation, where a deliberately partial fragment is legitimate input.
