// Agent-local route-graph types.
//
// Per Agent rationale, these types live ONLY in @icm/agent-routing. They MUST NOT
// appear in @icm/agent-adapter request/response schemas, MUST NOT appear in
// @icm/model project schema, MUST NOT be persisted into project.icproj.json,
// and MUST NOT survive across sessions. They carry no select/query/region
// capability; their input is a derived slice of an existing Snapshot.
//
// The Agent gives a complete local Route graph (nodes + edges with roles); the
// helper only projects each edge onto legal octilinear coordinates. The helper never
// decides topology, adds a missing node, switches a shape, or reroutes.
