/**
 * Repair bound format overrides that no longer read as the name they present.
 *
 * #463 retired the rule that capitalized an identifier's leading character.
 * Every override authored before that carries the capital the old compiler
 * produced, so a terminal named `reset` has an override reading `Reset` — and
 * the schema refuses the whole Project, because a bound override must still
 * say the name it decorates.
 *
 * The circuits this hits are already published. A published circuit that will
 * not open is, to its author, a circuit that is gone, so loading repairs the
 * override rather than refusing the file.
 *
 * The repair rewrites only the characters, through the same helper the editor
 * uses, so the author's italic, bold, and subscript survive: the text was
 * wrong, the formatting never was. An override that cannot be reconciled —
 * one whose name has since disappeared — is dropped, and the label falls back
 * to the house style rather than taking the Project down with it.
 *
 * The semantic name comes from `boundAnnotationName`, the same
 * function the schema checks against. A repair computed any other way would
 * either miss files the check still refuses or claim success on a file that
 * still cannot load.
 *
 * This runs on every load rather than as one numbered migration step. An
 * override is derived from the name it decorates, so the two agreeing is a
 * standing invariant, not a format that changed once: a file written at any
 * version by any client is repaired the same way. It also costs nothing on
 * the overwhelming majority of Projects, where no annotation carries an
 * override at all.
